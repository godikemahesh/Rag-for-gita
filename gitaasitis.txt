Originally I wrote Bhagavad-gétä As It Is  in the form in which it is
presented now. When this book was first published, the original manuscript
was, unfortunately, cut short to less th an 400 pages, without illustrations and
without explanations for most of  the original verses of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä.  In all of my other books— Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Çré Éçopaniñad,
etc.—the system is that I give the orig inal verse, its English transliteration,
word-for-word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purpo rts. This
makes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning
self-evident. I was not very happy, th erefore, when I had to minimize my
original manuscript. But later on, when the demand for Bhagavad-gétä As It Is
considerably increased, I was  requested by many scholars and devotees to
present the book in its original form. Th us the present attempt is to offer the
original manuscript of this great book of knowledge with full paramparä
explanation in order to establish the Kåñëa consciousness mo vement more
soundly and progressively.
Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized,
natural and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-gétä As It Is.  It
is gradually becoming the most popu lar movement in the entire world,
especially amongst the younger genera tion. It is becoming more and more
interesting to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming
interested, so much so that the father s and grandfathers of my disciples are
encouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the
Interna tional Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers
and mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of gratitude for
my leading the Kåñëa consciousness movement throughout the entire world.
Some of them said that it is greatl y fortunate for the Americans that I have
started the Kåñëa consciousness moveme nt in America. But actually theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.original father of this movement is Lo rd Kåñëa Himself, since it was started a
very long time ago but is coming down to human society by discipl ic
succession. If I have any credit in this  connection, it does not belong to me
personally, but it is due to my eterna l spiritual master, His Divine Grace Oà
Viñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya 108 Çré Çrémad Bhaktisiddhänta
Sarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja Prabhupäda.
If personally I have any credit in this  matter, it is only that I have tried to
present Bhagavad-gétä  as it is, without any adulteration. Before my
presentation of Bhagavad-gétä As It Is,  almost all the English editions of
Bhagavad-gétä  were introduced to fulfill someone’s personal ambition. But our
attempt, in presenting Bhagavad-gétä As It Is,  is to present the mission of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.  Our business is to present the will of
Kåñëa, not that of any mundane speculator like the po litician, philosopher or
scientist, for they have very little kno wledge of Kåñëa, despite all their other
knowledge. When Kåñëa says, man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäà
namaskuru  [Bg. 18.65 ], etc., we, unlike the so-called scholars, do not say that
Kåñëa and His inner spirit are different . Kåñëa is absolute, and there is no
difference between Kåñëa’s name, Kåñëa’ s form, Kåñëa’s qualities, Kåñëa’s
pastimes, etc. This absolute position of Kåñëa is difficult to understand for any
person who is not a devote e of Kåñëa in the system of paramparä  (disciplic
succession). Generally the so-called scholars, politicians, philosophers, and
svämés,  without perfect knowledge of Kåñëa, try to banish or kill Kåñëa when
writing commentary on Bhagavad-gétä.  Such unauthoriz ed commentary upon
Bhagavad-gétä  is known as Mäyäväda-bhäñya,  and Lord Caitanya has warned us
about these unauthorized men. Lord C aitanya clearly says that anyone who
tries to understand Bhagavad-gétä  f r o m  t h e  M ä y ä v ä d é  p o i n t  o f  v i e w  w i l l
commit a great blu nder. The result of such a blun der will be that the misguided
student of Bhagavad-gétä  will certainly be bewildered on the path of spiritual
guidance and will not be able to go back to home, back to Godhead.
Our only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-gétä As It Is  in order to guide
the conditioned student to the same pu rpose for which Kåñëa descends to this
planet once in a day of Brahmä, or every 8,600,000,000 years. This purpose is
stated in Bhagavad-gétä,  and we have to accept it as  it is; otherwise there is noCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.point in trying to understand the Bhagavad-gétä  and its speaker, Lord Kåñëa.
Lord Kåñëa first spoke Bhagavad-gétä  to the sun-god some hundreds of millions
o f  y e a r s  a g o .  W e  h a v e  t o  a c c e p t  t h i s  f a c t  a nd thus understand the historical
significance of Bhagavad-gétä,  without misinterpretation, on the authority of
Kåñëa. To interpret Bhagavad-gétä  without any reference to the will of Kåñëa is
the greatest offense. In order to save oneself from this offense , one has to
understand the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He was
directly understood by Arjuna, Lord Kå ñëa’s first disciple. Such understanding
of Bhagavad-gétä  is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human
society in fulfil ling the mission of life.
The Kåñëa consciousness movement is essential in human society, for it
offers the highest perfection of life. Ho w this is so is explained fully in the
Bhagavad-gétä.  Unfortunately, mundane wranglers have taken advantage of
Bhagavad-gétä  to push forward the ir demonic propensities and mislead people
regarding right understanding of the simp le principles of life. Everyone should
k n o w  h o w  G o d ,  o r  K å ñ ë a ,  i s  g r e a t ,  and everyone should know the factual
position of the living entities. Everyone should know that a l iving entity is
eternally a servant and that unless one serves Kåñëa one has to serve illusion
in different varieties of the three modes of material nature and thus wander
perpetually within the cycle of birth an d death; even the so-called liberated
Mäyävä dé speculator has to undergo this pr ocess. This knowledge constitutes a
great science, and each and every living being has to hear it for his own
interest.
People in general, especially in this Age of Kali, are enamored by the
external energy of Kåñëa, and they wrongly think that by advancement of
material comforts every man will be ha ppy. They have no knowledge that the
material or external nature is very st rong, for everyone is strongly bound by
the stringent laws of material nature. A living entity is happily the part and
parcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render immediate service
to the Lord. By the spell of illusion one tries to be ha ppy by serving his
personal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him
happy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy
the senses of the Lord. That is the high est perfection of life. The Lord wantsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.this, and He demands it. One has to understand this central point of
Bhagavad-gétä.  Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is teaching the whole
world this central point, and becaus e we are not polluting the theme of
Bhagavad-gétä As It Is,  anyone seriously interes ted in deriving benefit by
studying the Bhagavad-gétä  must take help from the Kåñëa consciousness
movement for practical understanding of Bhagavad-gétä  under the direct
guidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest
benefit by studying Bhagavad-gétä As It Is  as we have presented it here, and if
even one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, we shall consider our
attempt a success.

Bhagavad-gétä  is also known as Gétopaniñad.  It is the essence of Vedic
knowledge and one of the most important Upaniñads  in Vedic literature. Of
course there are many commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-gétä,  and one
may question the necessity for anot her one. This present edition can be
explained in the following way. Rece ntly an American lady asked me to
recommend an English translation of Bhagavad-gétä.  Of course in America
there are so many editions of Bhagavad-gétä  available in English, but as far as I
have seen, not only in America but also in India, none of them can be strictly
said to be authoritative because in al most every one of them the commentator
has expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-gétä  as
it is.
The spirit of Bhagavad-gétä  is mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä  itself. It is just
like this: If we want to take a particul ar medicine, then we have to follow the
directions written on the label. We ca nnot take the medicine according to our
own whim or the direc tion of a friend. It must be taken according to the
directions on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly,
Bhagavad-gétä  s h o u l d  b e  t a k e n  o r  a c c e p t e d  a s  i t  i s  d i r e c t e d  b y  t h e  s p e a k e r
Himself. The speaker of Bhagavad-gétä  is Lord Çré Kåñë a. He is mentioned onCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.every page of Bhagavad-gétä  as the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Bhagavän. Of course the word bhagavän  sometimes refers to any powerful
person or any powerful demigod, and certainly here bhagavän  designates Lord
Çré Kåñëa as a great  personality, but at the same time we should know that
Lord Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead, as is confirmed by all
great äcäryas  (spiritual masters) like Çaìkaräcärya, Rämänujäcärya,
Madhväcärya, Nimbärka Svämé, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and  many other
authorities of Vedic knowledge in Ind ia. The Lord Himself also establishes
Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-gétä,  and He
is accepted as such in the Brahma-saàhitä  and all the Puräëas,  especially the
Çrémad-Bhägavata m, known as the Bhägavata Puräëa  (kåñëas tu bhagavän
svayam ). Therefore we should take Bhagavad-gétä  as it is directed by the
Personality of Godhead Himself. In the Fourth Chapter of the Gétä (4.1–3 ) the
Lord says:
imaà vivasvate yogaà
proktavän aham avyayam
vivasvän manave präha
manur ikñväkave ’bravét
 [Bg. 4.1]
evaà paramparä-präptam

 [Bg. 4.2]
sa eväyaà mayä te ’dya

 [Bg. 4.3]
Here the Lord informs Arjuna that this system of yoga,  the Bhagavad-gétä,
was first spoken to the sun-god, and the sun-god explained it to Manu, andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Manu explained it to Ikñväku, and in that way, by disciplic succession, one
speaker after another, this yoga system has been coming down. But in the
course of time it has become lost. Cons equently the Lord has to speak it again,
this time to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra.
He tells Arjuna that He is relating  this supreme secret to him because
Arjuna is His devotee and His frie nd. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-gétä
is a treatise which is especially mean t for the devotee of the Lord. There are
three classes of transcend entalists, namely the jïäné,  the yogé and the bhakta,
or the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells
Arjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new paramparä  (disciplic
succession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord’s wish,
therefore, to establish another paramparä  in the same line of thought that was
coming down from the sun-god to others , and it was His wish that His teaching
be distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the autho rity in
understanding the Bhagavad-gétä.  So we see that Bhagavad-gétä  is instructed to
Arjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student
of Kåñëa, and His intimate friend. Therefore Bhagavad-gétä  is best understood
by a person wh o has qualities similar to Arjuna’s. That is to say he must be a
devotee in a direct relationship with  the Lord. As soon as one becomes a
devotee of the Lord, he also has a direct  relationship with the Lord. That is a
very elaborate subject matter, but bri efly it can be stated that a devotee is in a
relationship with the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead in one of five different
ways:
1. One may be a devotee in a passive state;
2. One may be a devotee in an active state;
3. One may be a devotee as a friend;
4. One may be a devotee as a parent;
5. One may be a devotee as a conjugal lover.
Arjuna was in a relationship with the Lord as friend. Of course there is a
gulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the
material world. This is transcendent al friendship, which cannot be had by
everyone. Of course everyone has  a particular relationship with the Lord, andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.that relationship is evoked by the perfec tion of devotional service. But in the
present status of our life, not only ha ve we forgotten the Supreme Lord, but we
have forgotten our eternal relationship with the L ord. Every living being, out
of the many, many billions and trillions of living beings, has a particular
relationship with the Lord eternally. That is called svarüpa.  By the process of
devotional service, one can revive that svarüpa,  and that stage is call ed
svarüpa-siddhi —perfection of one’s constitutional position. So Arjuna was a
devotee, and he was in touch with the Supreme Lord in friendship.
How Arjuna accepted this Bhagavad-gétä  should be noted. His manner of
acceptance is given in the Tenth Chapter ( 10.12–14 ):
arjuna uväca
paraà brahma paraà dhäma
pavitraà paramaà bhavän
puruñaà çäçvataà divyam
ädi-devam ajaà vibhum
ähus tväm åñayaù sarve
devarñir näradas tathä
asito devalo vyäsaù
svayaà caiva bravéñi me
sarvam etad åtaà manye
yan mäà vadasi keçava
na hi te bhagavan vyaktià
vidur devä na dänaväù
“Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Pe rsonality of Godhead, the ultimate
abode, the purest, the Absolute Truth. You are the eternal, transcendental,
original person, the unborn, the greatest. All the great sages such as Närada,
Asita, Devala, and Vyäsa confi rm this truth about You, and now You Yourself
are declaring it to me. O Kåñëa, I totally accept as truth all that You have told
me. Neither the demigods nor the demons, O Lord, can understand Your
personality.”
After hearing Bhagavad-gétä  from the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Arjuna accepted Kåñëa as paraà brahma,  the Supreme Brahman. Every living
being is Brahman, but the supreme living  being, or the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is the Supreme Brahman. Paraà dhäma  means that He is the
supreme rest or abode of everything; pavitram  means that He is pure, untainted
by material contamination; puruñam  means that He is the supreme enjoyer;
çäçvatam,  original; divyam,  transcendental; ädi-devam,  the Supreme Persona lity
of Godhead; ajam,  the unborn; and vibhum,  the greatest.
Now one may think that because Kåñëa was the friend of Arjuna, Arjuna
was telling Him all this by way of flattery, but Arjuna, just to drive out this
kind of doubt from the minds of the readers of Bhagavad-gétä,  substantiates
these praises in the next vers e when he says that Kåñëa is accepted as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead not only  by himself but by authorities like
Närada, Asita, Devala and Vyäsadeva.  These are great personalities who
distribute the Vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all äcäryas.  Therefore
Arjuna tells Kåñëa that he accepts whatever He says to be completely perfect.
Sarvam etad åtaà manye : “I accept everything You say to be true.” Arjuna also
says that the personality of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that He
cannot b e known even by the great demi gods. This means that the Lord
cannot even be known by personalities greater than human beings. So how
can a human being understand Lord Çré Kåñëa without becoming His devotee?
Therefore Bhagavad-gétä  should be taken up in a spirit of devotion. One
should not think that he is equal to Kå ñëa, nor should he think that Kåñëa is
an ordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord Çré Kåñëa is the
Supreme Personality of God head. So according to the statements of
Bhagavad-gétä  or the statements of Arjuna , the person who is trying to
understand the Bhagavad-gétä,  we should at least theoretically accept Çré Kåñëa
as the Supreme Personality of Godh ead, and with that submissive s pirit we can
understand the Bhagavad-gétä.  Unless one reads the Bhagavad-gétä  in a
submissive spirit, it is very difficult to understand Bhagavad-gétä,  because it is a
great mystery.
Just what is the Bhagavad-gétä ? The purpose of Bhagavad-gétä  is to deliver
mankind from the nescience of material existence. Every man is in difficulty
in so many ways, as Arjuna also was in  difficulty in having to fight the BattleCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.of Kurukñetra. Arjuna su rrendered unto Çré Kåñëa, and consequently this
Bhagavad-gétä  was spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of us is full of
anxieties because of this material exis tence. Our very existence is in the
atmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be  threatened by
nonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are put into
asat.  Asat  refers to that which does not exist.
Out of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are
actually inquiring about their position, as  to what they are, why they are put
into this awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position
of questioning his suffering , unless he realizes that he doesn’t want suffering
but rather wants to make a solution to  all suffering, then one is not to be
considered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry
is awakened in one’s mind. In the Brahma-sütra  this inquiry is called brahma
jijïäsä.  Athäto brahma jijïäsä . Every activity of the human being is to be
considered a failure unless he inquires about the nature of the Absolute.
Therefore those who begin to question why they are suffering or where they
came fr om and where they shall go afte r death are proper students for
understanding Bhagavad-gétä.  The sincere student should also have a firm
respect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna.
Lord Kåñëa descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when
man forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many human beings who
awaken, there may be one who actually en ters the spirit of understanding his
position, and for him this Bhagavad-gétä  is spoken. Actually we are all
swallowed by the tigress of nescience, bu t the Lord is very merciful upon living
entities, especially human beings. To this end He spoke the Bhagavad-gétä,
making His friend Arjuna His student.
Being an associate of Lord Kåñëa, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but
Arjuna was put into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra just to
question Lord Kåñëa about the problems of life so that the Lord could explain
them for the benefit of future genera tions of human beings and chalk out the
plan of life. Then man could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human
life.
The subject of the Bhagavad-gétä  entails the comprehension of five basicCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.truths. First of all, the science of God is explained and then the constitutional
position of the living entities, jévas.  There is éçvara,  which means the
controller, and there are jévas, the living entities which are controlled. If a
living entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane.
The living being is controlled in every re spect, at least in his conditioned life.
So in the Bhagavad-gétä  the subject matter deals with the éçvara,  the supreme
controller, and the jévas,  the controlled living entities. Prakåti (material
nature) and time (the duration of ex istence of the whole universe or the
manifestation of material nature) and karma  (activity) are also discussed. The
cosmic manifestation is full of different  activities. All living entities are
engaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-gétä  we must learn what God is,
what the living entities are, what prakåti  is, what the cosmic manifestation is,
how it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are.
Out of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-gétä  it is established that
the Supreme Godhead, or Kåñëa, or Brahman, or the supreme controller, or
Paramätmä—you may use whatever name yo u like—is the greatest of all. The
living beings are in quality l ike the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord
has control over the universal affairs of material nature, as will be explained in
the later chapters of Bhagavad-gétä.  Material nature is not independent. She is
acting under the directions of the Supreme  Lord. As Lord Kåñëa says,
mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram : “This material nature is working
under My direction.” When we see wond erful things happening in the cosmic
nature, we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a
contro ller. Nothing could be manifested with out being controlled. It is childish
not to consider the controller. For instance, a child may think that an
automobile is quite wonderful to be able  to run without a horse or other animal
pulling it, but a sane man kn ows the nature of the automobile’s engineering
arrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery there is a man, a
driver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the driver under whose direction
everything is working. Now the jévas,  or the living entities, ha ve been accepted
by the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels. A
particle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, and
similarly we the living entities, be ing part and parcel of the supremeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.control ler, éçvara,  or Bhagavän, Lord Çré Kåñëa, have all the qualities of the
Supreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute éçvaras,  subordinate
éçvaras.  We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control
space or planets, and this te ndency to control is there because it is in Kåñëa.
But although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we should
know that we are not the suprem e controller. This is explained in
Bhagavad-gétä.
What is material nature? This is also explained in Gétä as inferior prakåti,
inferior nature. The living entity  is explained as the superior prakåti.  Prakåti  is
always under control, whether inferior or superior. Prakåti  is female, and she is
controlled by  the Lord just as the activities  of a wife are controlled by the
husband. Prakåti  is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the
predominator. The living entities and ma terial nature are both predominated,
controlled by the Supreme Lord. Accor ding to the Gétä,  the living entities,
although parts and parcels of the Su preme Lord, are to be considered prakåti.
This is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.  Apareyam
itas tv anyäà prakåtià viddhi me paräm/ jéva-bhütäm : “This mate rial nature is
My inferior prakåti,  but beyond this is another prakåti—jéva-bhütäm,  the living
entity.”
Material nature itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of
goodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes
there is eternal time, and by a combinat ion of these modes of nature and under
the control and purview of etern al time there are activities, which are called
karma.  These activities are being carried out from time immemorial, and we
are suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am
a businessman and have worked very hard with intell igence and have amassed
a great bank balance. Then I am an en joyer. But then say I have lost all my
money in business; then I am a sufferer. Similarly, in every field of life we
enjoy the results of our work, or we suffer the results. This is called karma.
Éçvara (the Supreme Lord), jéva (the living entity), prakåti  (nature), käla
(eternal time) and karma  (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad-gétä.  Out
of these five, the Lord, the living entiti es, material nature and time are eternal.
The manifestatio n of prakåti  may be temporary, but it is not false. SomeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.philosophers say that the manifestatio n of material nature is false, but
according to the philosophy of Bhagavad-gétä  or according to the philosophy of
the Vaiñëavas, this is not so. The manifestatio n of the world is not accepted as
false; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which
moves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season, which nourishes
grains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud g oes away,
all the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material
manifestation takes place at a certain  interval, stays for a while and then
disappears. Such are the workings of prakåti.  But this cycle is working
eternally. Therefo re prakåti  is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to this as
“My prakåti. ” This material nature is the separated energy of the Supreme
Lord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord,
although they are not separated bu t eternally related. So the Lord, the living
entity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal.
However, the other item, karma,  is not eternal. The effects of karma  may be
very old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of  our activities from
time immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma,  or our activity,
and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are engaged
in various activities. Undoubtedly we do  not know what sort of activities we
shoul d adopt to gain relief from the action s and reactions of all these activities,
but this is also explained in the Bhagavad-gétä.
The position of éçvara,  the Supreme Lord, is that of supreme consciousness.
The jévas,  or the living entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord,
are also conscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as
prakåti,  the energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the jéva, is
conscious. The other prakåti  is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore
the jéva-prakåti  is called superior because the jéva has consciousness which is
similar to the Lord’s. The Lord’s is supr eme consciousness, however, and one
should not claim that the jéva, the living entity, is also supremely conscious.
The living being cannot be supremely cons cious at any stage of his perfection,
and the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory. Cons cious he may be,
but he is not perfectly or supremely conscious.
The distinction between the jéva and the éçvara  will be explained in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.  The Lord is kñetra-jïa,  conscious, as is
the living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body,
whereas the Lord is conscious  of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of
every living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular
jévas.  We should not forget this. It is al so explained that the Paramätmä, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is living in ever yone’s heart as éçvara,  as the
controller, and that He is giving directio ns for the living entity to act as he
desires. The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a
determination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the act ions
and reactions of his own karma.  After giving up one type of body, he enters
another type of body, as we put on an d take off clothes. As the soul thus
migrates, he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These
activities can be change d when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in
sanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so,
then all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed.
Consequently, karma  is not eternal. Therefore w e stated that of the five items
(éçvara, jéva, prakåti,  time and karma ) four are eternal, whereas karma  is not
eternal.
The supreme conscious éçvara  is similar to the living entity in this way: both
the consciousness of the Lord and that of  the living entity are transcendental.
It is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter. That is a
mistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops under certain
circumstances of material combin ation is not accepted in the Bhagavad-gétä.
Consciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material
circumstances, just as light reflected through colored g lass may appear to be a
certain color, but the consciousness of th e Lord is not materially affected. Lord
Kåñëa says, mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù  [Bg. 9.10]. When He descends into the
material universe, His consciousness is not materially affected. If He were s o
affected, He would be unfit to speak on  transcendental matters as He does in
the Bhagavad-gétä.  One cannot say anything about the transcendental world
without being free from materially contam inated consciousness. So the Lord is
not materially contaminat ed. Our consciousness, at the present moment,
however, is materially contaminated. The Bhagavad-gétä  teaches that we haveCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.to purify this materially contaminated consciousness. In pure consciousness,
our actions will be dovetailed to the will of éçvara,  and that will make us happy.
It is not that we have to cease all ac tivities. Rather, our activities are to be
purified, and purified activities are called bhakti.  Activities in bhakti  appear to
be like ordinary activities, but they are not contaminated. An ig norant person
may see that a devotee is acting or work ing like an ordinary man, but such a
person with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the
devotee or of the Lord are not cont aminated by impure consciousness or
matter. They are  transcendental to the three modes of nature. We should
know, however, that at this point our consciousness is contaminated.
When we are materially contaminated , we are called conditioned. False
consciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of material
nature. This is called false ego. One wh o is absorbed in the thought of bodily
conceptions cannot understa nd his situation. Bhagavad-gétä  was spoken to
liberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put himself in this
position in order to receive this info rmation from the Lord. One must become
free from the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary activity for the
transcendentalist. One who wants to become free, who wants to become
liberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body. Mukti,  or
liberation, means freedom from material consciousness. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavata m also the definition of liberation is given. Muktir
hitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù : mukti  means liberation from the
contaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure
consciousness. All the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä  are intended to awaken
this pure consciousness, and therefore we find at the last stage of the Gétä’s
instructions that Kåñëa is asking Arjuna whether he is now in purified
consciousness. Purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the
instructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum and substance of purified
consciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of
the Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior
modes. But the Lord, being the Supreme , is never affected. That is the
difference between the Supreme Lord and the small individual souls.
What is this consciousness? This cons ciousness is “I am.” Then what am I?Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.In contaminated consciousness “I am” mean s “I am the lord of all I survey. I am
the enjoyer.” The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is
the lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two
psychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the
enjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer,
and the living entity, being part and parcel of t he Supreme Lord, is neither the
creator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperato r. He is the created and the enjoyed.
For instance, a part of a machine cooper ates with the whole machine; a part of
the body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, legs, eyes, and  so on are
all parts of the body, but they are not ac tually the enjoyers. The stomach is the
enjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew, and all parts of
the body are engaged in satisfying th e stomach because the stomach is the
principal  factor that nourishes the body’s organization. Therefore everything is
given to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one
nourishes the body by feeding the stomach,  for if the body is to be kept in a
healthy state, then the parts o f the body must cooperate to feed the stomach.
Similarly, the Supreme Lord is th e enjoyer and the creator, and we, as
subordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This
cooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomac h will help all
other parts of the body. If the fingers of  the hand think that they should take
the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be
frustrated. The central figure of crea tion and of enjoyment is the Supreme
Lord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The
relation is also like that of the master  and the servant. If the master is fully
satisfied, then the servant is satisfied.  Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be
satisfied, although the ten dency to become the creator and the tendency to
enjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these
tendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested
cosmic world.
We shall find, therefore, in this Bhagavad-gétä  that the complete whole is
comprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic
manifestation, eternal time and karma,  or activities, and all of these are
explained in this text. Al l of these taken completely form the complete whole,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.and the complete whole is called the Supreme Absolute Truth. The complete
whole and the complete Absolute Tr uth are the complete Personality of
Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. All manife stations are due to His diffe rent energies. He is
the complete whole.
It is also explained in the Gétä that impersonal Brahman is also subordinate
to the complete Supreme Person ( brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham ). Brahman is more
explicitly explained in the Brahma-sütra  t o  b e  l i k e  t h e  r a y s  o f  t h e  s u n s h i n e .
The impersonal Brahman is the shining rays of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomple te realization of the absolute whole,
and so also is the conception of Paramä tmä. In the Fifteenth Chapter it shall
be seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruñ ottama, is above both
impersonal Brahman and the partial re alization of Paramätmä. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is called sac-cid-änanda-vigraha.  The Brahma-saàhitä
begins in this way: éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù/ anädir ädir
govin daù sarva-käraëa-käraëam . “Govinda, Kåñëa, is the cause of all causes. He
is the primal cause, and He is the very  form of eternity, knowledge and bliss.”
Impersonal Brahman realization is the realization of His sat (eternity) feature.
Paramätmä realization  is the realization of sat-cit  (eternal knowledge). But
realization of the Personality of Godhea d, Kåñëa, is realization of all the
transcendental features: sat, cit  and änanda  (eternity, knowledge, and bliss) in
complete vigraha  (form).
People with less intelligence consider the Supreme Truth to be impersonal,
but He is a transcendental person, and this is confirmed in all Vedic
literatures. Nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm.  (Kaöha Upaniñad  2.2.13 ) As we
are all individual living beings a nd have our individuality, the Supreme
Absolute Truth is also, in the ultimate issue, a person, and realization of the
Personality of Godhead is realization of  all of the transcendental features in
His complete form. The complete whole is not formless. If He is formless, or if
He is less than any other thing, then He cannot be the complete whole. The
complete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond our
experience, otherwise it cannot be complete.
The complete whole, Personality of Godhead, has immense potencies
(paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate ). How Kåñëa is acting in different potencies isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.also explained in Bhagavad-gétä.  This phenomenal world or material world in
which we are placed is also com plete in itself because the twenty-four elements
of which this material universe is a temporary manifestation, according to
Säìkhya philosophy, are completely adju sted to produce complete resources
which are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of  this universe.
There is nothing extraneous, nor is ther e anything needed. This manifestation
has its own time fixed by the energy of  the supreme whole, and when its time
is complete, these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the
complete arran gement of the complete. There is complete facility for the small
complete units, namely the living entiti es, to realize the complete, and all sorts
of incompleteness are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the
complete. So Bhagavad-gétä  contains the  complete knowledge of Vedic wisdom.
All Vedic knowledge is infallible, and Hindus accept Vedic knowledge to be
complete and infallible. For example, cow dung is the stool of an animal, and
according to småti,  or Vedic injunction, if one touches the stool of an animal
he has to take a bath to  purify himself. But in the Vedic scriptures cow dung is
considered to be a purifying agent. One might consider this to be
contradictory, but it is accepted becaus e it is Vedic injunction, and indeed by
accepting this, one will not commit a mistake; subseq uently it has been proved
by modern science that cow dung cont ains all antiseptic properties. So Vedic
knowledge is complete because it is above all doubts and mistakes, and
Bhagavad-gétä  is the essence of all Vedic knowledge.
Vedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is
imperfect because we are researching thin gs with imperfect senses. We have to
accept perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in Bhagavad-gétä,  by
the paramparä  (disciplic successi on). We have to receive knowledge from the
proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual
master, the Lord Himself, and handed  down to a succession of spiritual
masters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from Lord Çré Kåñëa, accepts
everything that He says without cont radicting Him. One is not allowed to
accept one portion of Bhagavad-gétä  and not another. No. We must accept
Bhagavad-gétä  without interpretation, withou t deletion and without our own
whimsical participation in t he matter. The Gétä should be taken as the mostCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.perfect presentation of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from
transcendental sources, and the first wo rds were spoken by the Lord Himself.
The words spoken by the Lord are called apauruñeya,  meani ng that they are
different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected
with four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably
illusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect
senses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information
of all-pervading knowledge.
Vedic knowledge is not imparted by su ch defective living entities. It was
imparted unto the heart of Brahmä, the first created living being, and Brahmä
in his turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples, as he
originally received it from the  Lord. The Lord is pürëam,  all-perfect, and there
is no possibility of His becoming subjected to the laws of material nature. One
should therefore be intelligent enough to know that the Lord is the only
proprietor of everything in the universe and that He is the original creator,
the creator of Brahmä. In the Eleven th Chapter the Lord is addressed as
prapitämaha  [Bg. 11.39 ] because Brahmä is addressed as pitämaha,  the
grandfather, and He is the creator of the grandfather. So no one should claim
to be the pr oprietor of anything; one should accept only things which are set
aside for him by the Lord as his quota for his maintenance.
There are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which
are set aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä.  In the
beginning, Arjuna decided that he should not fight in the Battle of
Kurukñetra. This was his own dec ision. Arjuna told the Lord that it was not
possible for him to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen. This
decision was based on the body becaus e he was thinking that the body was
himself and that his bodily relations or expansions were his brot hers, nephews,
brothers-in-law, grandfathers and so on . Therefore he wanted to satisfy his
bodily demands. Bhagavad-gétä  was spoken by the Lord just to change this
view, and at the end Arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the Lord
when he says, kariñye vacanaà tava  [Bg. 18.73 ]: “I shall act according to Your
word.”
In this world men are not meant for quarreling like cats and dogs. MenCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.must be intelligent to realize the import ance of human life and refuse to act
like ordinary animals. A human being sh ould realize the aim of his life, and
this direction is given in all  Vedic literatures, and the essence is given in
Bhagavad-gétä.  Vedic literature is meant for human beings, not for animals.
Animals can kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their
part, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfact ion of his uncontrolled taste,
he must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the Bhagavad-gétä  it
is clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the
different modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of
ignorance. Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in
goodness, passion and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we
properly utilize the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä,  then our whole life will
become purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which
is beyond this material sky. [ Bg. 15.6 ]
That destination is called the sanätana  sky, the eternal, spiritual sky. In this
material world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays
for some time, produces some by-product s, dwindles and then vanishes. That is
the law of the ma terial world, whether we use as an example this body, or a
piece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another
world of which we have information. Th at world consists of another nature,
which is sanätana,  eternal. Jéva is also desc ribed as sanätana,  eternal, and the
Lord is also described as sanätana  in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an
intimate relationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively
one—the sanätana-dhäma,  or sky, the sanätana  Supreme Personality and the
sanätana  living entities—the whole purpose of Bhagavad-gétä  is to revive our
sanätana  occupation, or sanätana-dharma,  which is the eternal occupation of
the living entity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of
these activities can be  purified when we give up all these temporary activities
and take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is
called our pure life.
The Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both sanätana,  as are
the living entities, and the combined a ssociation of the Supreme Lord and the
living entities in the sanätana  abode is the perfection of human life. The LordCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.i s  v e r y  k i n d  t o  t h e  l i v i n g  entities because they are His sons. Lord Kåñëa
declares in Bhagavad-gétä,  sarva-yoniñu.  .. ahaà béja-pradaù pitä : “I am the
father of all.” Of course there are all ty pes of living entities according to their
various karmas,  but here the Lord claims that H e is the father of all of them.
Therefore the Lord descends to reclaim a ll of these fallen, conditioned souls, to
call them back to the sanätana  eternal sky so that the sanätana  living entities
may regain their eternal sanätana  positions in eternal associa tion with the
Lord. The Lord comes Himself in diffe rent incarnations, or He sends His
confidential servants as sons or His associates or äcäryas  to reclaim the
conditioned souls.
Therefore, sanätana-dharma  does not refer to any sectarian process of
religion. It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship
with the eternal Supreme Lord. Sanätana-dharma  refers, as stated previously,
to the eternal occupation  of the living entity. Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya has
explained the word sanätana  as “that which has neither beginning nor end,” so
when we speak of sanätana-dharma,  w e  m u s t  t a k e  i t  f o r  g r a n t e d  o n  t h e
authority of Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya that it has neither begin ning nor end.
The English world religion  is a little different from sanätana-dharma.
Religion  conveys the idea of faith, and f aith may change. One may have faith
in a particular process, and he may ch ange this faith and adopt another, but
sanätana-dharma  refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For
instance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from
fire. Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be
taken from the living entity. Sanätana-dharma  is eternally integra l with the
living entity. When we speak of sanätana-dharma,  therefore, we must take it
for granted on the authority of Çrépäd a Rämänujäcärya that it has neither
beginning nor end. That which has ne ither end nor beginning must not be
sectarian, for it canno t be limited by any boundaries. Those belonging to some
sectarian faith will wrongly consider that sanätana-dharma  is also sectarian,
but if we go deeply into the matter an d consider it in the light of modern
science, it is possible for us to see that sanä tana-dharma  is the business of all
the people of the world—nay, of all the living entities of the universe.
Non- sanätana  religious faith may have some beginning in the annals ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.human history, but there is no beginning to the history of sanätana-dharma,
because it remains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living
entities are concerned, the autho ritative çästras  state that the living entity has
neither birth nor death. In the Gétä it is stated that the living entity is never
born and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to
live after the destruction of his temporary ma terial body. In reference to the
concept of sanätana-dharma,  we must try to understand the concept of religion
from the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. Dharma  refers to that which is
constantly existing with a particular  object. We conclude that there i s heat
and light along with the fire; without he at and light, there is no meaning to
the word fire. Similarly, we must discover  the essential part of the living being,
that part which is his constant compan ion. That constant companion is his
eternal qualit y, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.
When Sanätana Gosvämé asked Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu about the
svarüpa  of every living being, the Lord replied that the svarüpa,  or
constitutional position, of the living being is the rendering of service to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze  this statement of Lord
Caitanya’s, we can easily see that ever y living being is constantly engaged in
rendering service to another living being. A living being serves other living
beings in various capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. T he
lower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves B
master, B serves C master, and C serv es D master and so on. Under these
circumstances, we can see that one fr iend serves another friend, the mother
serves the son, the wife serv es the husband, the husband serves the wife and so
on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception
in the society of living beings to the activity of service. The politician presents
his manifesto for the public to conv ince them of his capacity for service. The
voters therefore give the politician thei r valuable votes, thinking that he will
render valuable service to society. Th e shopkeeper serves the customer, and
the artisan serves the capitalist. The capitalist serves  the family, and the family
serves the state in the terms of the eter nal capacity of the eternal living being.
In this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to
other living beings, and therefore we can safely conclude that se rvice is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.constant companion of the living being an d that the rendering of service is the
eternal religion of the living being.
Yet man professes to belong to a partic ular type of faith with reference to
particular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, Muslim,
Christian, Buddhist or an adherent of any other sect. Such designations are
non— sanätana-dharma.  A Hindu may  change his faith to become a Muslim, or
a Muslim may change his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change
his faith and so on. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does
not affect the eternal occupation of rendering service to o thers. The Hindu,
Muslim or Christian in all circumstances is servant of someone. Thus, to
profess a particular type of faith is not to profess one’s sanätana-dharma.  The
rendering of service is sanätana-dharma.
Factually we are related to the Suprem e Lord in service. The Supreme Lord
is the supreme enjoyer, and we living entities are His servitors. We are created
for His enjoyment, and if we participat e in that eternal enjoyment with the
Supreme Personality of Go dhead, we become happy. We cannot become happy
otherwise. It is not possible to be happy  independently, just as no one part of
the body can be happy without cooperating with the stomach. It is not possible
for the living entity to be happy without renderin g transcendental loving
service unto the Supreme Lord.
In the Bhagavad-gétä,  worship of different demigods or rendering service to
them is not approved. It is stated in the Seventh Chapter, twentieth verse :
kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù
prapadyante ’nya-devatäù
taà taà niyamam ästhäya
prakåtyä niyatäù svayä
“Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender
unto demigods and follow the particul ar rules and regulations of worship
according to their own natures.” Here it  is plainly said that those who are
directed by lust worship the demigo ds and not the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. When
we mention the name Kåñëa, we do  not refer to any sectarian name. Kåñëa
means the highest pleasure, and it is co nfirmed that the Supreme Lord is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.reservoir or storehouse of all pleasure. We are all hankering after  pleasure.
Änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät  (Vedänta-sütra  1.1.12 ). The living entities, like the Lord,
are full of consciousness, and they are after happiness. The Lord is perpetually
happy, and if the living entities assoc iate with the Lord, cooperate with Him
and t ake part in His association, then they also become happy.
The Lord descends to this mortal worl d to show His pastimes in Våndävana,
which are full of happiness. When Lord Çré Kåñëa was in Våndävana, His
activities with His cowherd boyfriends, wi th His damsel friends, with the other
inhabitants of Våndävana and wi th the cows were all full of happiness. The
total population of Våndävana knew no thing but Kåñëa. But Lord Kåñëa even
discouraged His father Nanda Mahäräja from worshiping the demigod Indra,
because He wanted to establish th e fact that people need not wors hip any
demigod. They need only worship th e Supreme Lord, because their ultimate
goal is to return to His abode.
The abode of Lord Çré Kåñëa is described in the Bhagavad-gétä,  Fifteenth
Chapter, sixth verse:
na tad bhäsayate süryo
na çaçäìko na pävakaù
yad gatvä na nivartante
tad dhäma paramaà mama
“That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by
fire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.”
This verse gives a description of that  e t e r n a l  s k y .  O f  c o u r s e  w e  h a v e  a
material conception of the sky, and we think of it in relationship to the sun,
moon, stars and so on, but in this verse the Lord states that in the eternal sky
there is no need for the  sun nor for the moon nor electricity or fire of any kind
because the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the brahmajyoti,  the rays
emanating from the Supreme Lord. We are trying with difficulty to reach
other planets, but it is not difficult to unders tand the abode of the Supreme
Lord. This abode is referred to as Goloka. In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.37) it is
beautifully described: goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù.  The Lord resides
eternally in His abode Goloka, yet He  can be approached from this worl d, andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.to this end the Lord comes to manifest His real form, sac-cid-änanda-vigraha
[Bs. 5.1]. When He manifests this form, ther e is no need for our imagining what
He looks like. To discourage such imaginative speculation, He descends and
exhibits Himself as He is, as Çyämasundara. Unfortunately, the less intelligent
deride Him because He comes as one of us and plays with us as a human being.
But because of this we should not consid er the Lord one of us. It is by His
omnipotency that He presents Himself in His real form before us and displays
His pastimes, which are replicas of those pastimes found in His abode.
In the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets
floating. The brahmajyoti  emanates from the supreme abode, Kåñëaloka, and
the änanda-maya, cin-maya  planets, which are not material, float in those rays.
The Lord says, na tad bhäsaya te süryo na çaçäìko na pävakaù/ yad gatvä na
nivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama [Bg. 15.6]. One who can approach that
spiritual sky is not required to descen d again to the material sky. In the
material sky, even if we approa ch the highest planet (Brahmaloka ), what to
speak of the moon, we will find the sa me conditions of life, namely birth,
death, disease and old age. No planet in the mat erial universe is free from
these four principles of material existence.
The living entities are traveling from one planet to another, but it is not
that we can go to any planet we like merely by a mechanical arrangement. If
we desire to go to other planets, there is a process for going there. This is also
mentioned: yänti deva -vratä devän pitèn yänti pitå-vratäù [Bg. 9.25]. No
mechanical arrangement is necessary if  we want interplanetary travel. The
Gétä instructs: yänti deva-vratä devän.  The moon, the sun and higher planets
are called Svargaloka. There are three different stat uses of planets: higher,
middle and lower planetary systems. The earth belongs to the middle planetary
system. Bhagavad-gétä  informs us how to travel to  the higher planetary systems
(Devaloka) with a very simple formula: yänti deva-vratä devän.  One need on ly
worship the particular demigod of that particular planet and in that way go to
the moon, the sun or any of the higher planetary systems.
Yet Bhagavad-gétä  does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this
material world, because even if we go to Brahmaloka, the highest planet,
through some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for fortyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.thousand years (and who would live th at long?), we will still find the material
inconveniences of birth, death, disease and old age. But one who wants to
approach the supreme planet, Kåñëaloka, or any of the other planets within
the spiritual sky, will not meet with these material inconvenien ces. Amongst
all of the planets in the spiritual sky there is one supreme planet called Goloka
Våndävana, which is the original pl anet in the abode of the original
Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. All of this information is given in
Bhagavad-gétä,  and we are given through its instruction information how to
leave the material world and begin a truly blissful life in the spiritual sky.
In the Fifteenth Chapter  of the Bhagavad-gétä,  the real picture of the
material world is given. It is said there:
ürdhva-mülam adhaù-çäkham
açvatthaà prähur avyayam
chandäàsi yasya parëäni
yas taà veda sa veda-vit
Here the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and
branches are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if
one stands on the bank of a river or an y reservoir of water, he can see that the
trees reflected in the w ater are upside down. The branches go downward and
the roots upward. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the spiritual
world. The material world is but a shadow  of reality. In the shadow there is no
reality or substantiality, but from the sha dow we can understand that there are
substance and reality. In the desert th ere is no water, but the mirage suggests
that there is such a thing as water. In the material world there is no water,
there is no happiness, but the real water of actual happiness  is there in the
spiritual world.
The Lord suggests that we attain the spiritual world in the following
manner ( Bg. 15.5):
nirmäna-mohä jita-saìga-doñä
adhyätma-nityä vinivåtta-kämäù
dvandvair vimuktäù sukha-duùkha-saàjïair
gacchanty amüòhäù padam avyayaà tatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.That padam avyayam,  or eternal kingdom, can be reached by one who is
nirmäna-moha.  What does this mean? We are after designations. Someone
wants to become “sir,” someone want s to become “lord,” someone wants to
become the president or a rich man or a king or something else. As long as we
are attached to these designations, we are attached to the body, because
designations belong to the body. But we are not these bodies, and realizing this
is the first stage in spiritual realization. We are associated with t he three modes
of material nature, but we must become  detached through devotional service
to the Lord. If we are not attached to devotional service to the Lord, then we
cannot become detached from the modes of material nature. Designations and
attachments are due to our lust and desire, ou r wanting to lord it over the
material nature. As long as we do not gi ve up this propensity of lording it over
material nature, there is no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the
Supreme, the sanätana-dhäma.  That e ternal kingdom, which is never
destroyed, can be approached by one who is not bewildered by the attractions
of false material enjoyments, who is si tuated in the service of the Supreme
Lord. One so situated can easily approach that supreme abode.
Elsewhere in the Gétä (8.21) it is stated:
avyakto ’kñara ity uktas
tam ähuù paramäà gatim
yaà präpya na nivartante
tad dhäma paramaà mama
Avyakta  means unmanifested. Not even all of the material world is
manifested before us. Our senses are so  imperfect that we cannot even see all
of the stars within this material universe. In Vedic literature we can receive
much information about all the pl anets, and we can believe it or not believe it.
All of the important planets are described in Vedic literatures, especially
Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  and the spiritual world, which is beyond this material sky,
is described as avyakta,  unmanifested. One should des ire and hanker after that
supreme kingdom, for when one attains that kingdom, he does not have to
return to this material world.
Next, one may raise the question of how one goes about approaching thatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.abode of the Supreme Lord. Informatio n of this is given in the Eighth
Chapter. It is said there:
anta-käle ca mäm eva
smaran muktvä kalevaram
yaù prayäti sa mad-bhävaà
yäti nästy atra saàçayaù
“Anyone who quits his body, at the end of life, remembering Me, attains
immediately to My nature; and there is no doubt of this.” [ Bg. 8.5] One who
thinks of Kåñëa at the time of his deat h goes to Kåñëa. One must remember the
form of Kåñëa; if he quits his  body thinking of this form, he surely approaches
the spiritual kingdom. Mad-bhävam  refers to the supreme nature of the
Supreme Being. The Supreme Being is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha  [Bs. 5.1]—that
is, His form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. Our pres ent body is not
sac-cid-änanda.  It is asat,  not sat. It is not eternal; it is perishable. It is not cit,
full of knowledge, but it is full of ig norance. We have no knowledge of the
spiritual kingdom, nor do we even ha ve perfect knowledge of this material
world, where there are so many things  unknown to us. The body is also
niränanda;  instead of being full of bliss it is  full of misery. All of the miseries
we experience in the material world arise from the body, but one who leaves
this body thinking of Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at
once attains a sac-cid-änanda  body.
The process of quitting this body an d getting another body in the material
world is also organized. A man dies after it has been decided what form of body
he will have in the next life. Higher authorities, not the living entity himself,
make this decision.  According to our activities in this life, we either rise or
sink. This life is a preparation for the ne xt life. If we can prepare, therefore, in
this life to get promotion to the king dom of God, then surely, after quitting
this material body, we will atta in a spiritual body just like the Lord’s.
As explained before, there are differe nt kinds of transcendentalists—the
brahma-vädé, paramätma-vädé  and the devotee—and, as mentioned, in the
brahmajyoti  (spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. The
number of these planets is far, far grea ter than all of the planets of thisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.material world. This material world has been approximated as only one quarter
of the creation ( ekäàçena sthito jagat ). In this material segment there are
millions and billions of universes with trillions of planets and s uns, stars and
moons. But this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total
creation. Most of the creation is in th e spiritual sky. One who desires to merge
into the existence of the Supreme Brah man is at once transferred to the
brahmajyoti  of t he Supreme Lord and thus attains the spiritual sky. The
devotee, who wants to enjoy the assoc iation of the Lord, enters into the
Vaikuëöha planets, which are innumerable, and the Supreme Lord by His
plenary expansions as Näräyaëa with four hands and with d ifferent names like
Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Govinda associates with him there. Therefore at
the end of life the transcendentalists think either of the brahmajyoti,  the
Paramätmä or Supreme Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. In all cases they
enter into the  spiritual sky, but only the devotee, or he who is in personal
touch with the Supreme Lord, enters into the Vaikuëöha planets or the
Goloka Våndävana planet. The Lord furt her adds that of this “there is no
doubt.” This must be believed firmly. We should no t reject that which does not
tally with our imagination; our attitude s h o u l d  b e  t h a t  o f  A r j u n a :  “ I  b e l i e v e
everything that You have said.” Therefor e when the Lord says that at the time
of death whoever thinks of Him as  Brahman or Paramätmä or as the
Person ality of Godhead certainly enters in to the spiritual sky, there is no
doubt about it. There is no question of disbelieving it.
The Bhagavad-gétä  (8.6) also explains the general principle that makes it
possible to enter the spiritual kingdom simply by thinking of the Supreme at
the time of death:
yaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà
tyajaty ante kalevaram
taà tam evaiti kaunteya
sadä tad-bhäva-bhävitaù
“Whatever state of being one remember s when he quits his present body, in
his next life he will attain to that state without fail.” Now, first we must
understand that material nature is a display of one of the energies of theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Supreme Lord. In the Viñëu Pur äëa (6.7.61 ) the total energies of the Supreme
Lord are delineated:
viñëu-çaktiù parä proktä
kñetra-jïäkhyä tathä parä
avidyä-karma-saàjïänyä
tåtéyä çaktir iñyate
 [Cc. Madhya 6.154 ]
The Supreme Lord has diverse and innumerable energies which are beyond
our conception; however, great learned sages or liberated souls have studied
these energies and have analyzed them in to three parts. All of the energies are
of viñëu-çakti,  that is to s ay they are different potencies of Lord Viñëu. The
first energy is parä,  transcendental. Living entities also belong to the superior
energy, as has already been explained. Th e other energies, or material energies,
are in the mode of ignorance. At the time of death either we can remain in the
inferior energy of this material world, or we can transfer to the energy of the
spiritual world. So the Bhagavad-gétä  (8.6) says:
yaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà
tyajaty ante kalevaram
taà tam evaiti kaunteya
sadä tad-bhäva-bhävitaù
“Whatever state of being one remember s when he quits his present body, in
his next life he will attain to that state without fail.”
In life we are accustomed to thinking  either of the material or of the
spiritual energy. Now, how can we tran sfer our thoughts from the material
energy to the spiritual energy? There are so many literatures which fill our
thoughts with the material energy— newspapers, magazines, novels, etc. Our
thinking, which is now absorbed in these literatures, must be transferred to the
Vedic literatures. The great sages, th erefore, have written so many Vedic
literatures, such as the Puräëas.  The Puräëas  are not imagina tive; they are
historical records. In the Caitanya-caritämåta  (Madhya  20.122 ) there is the
following verse:Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.mäyä-mugdha jévera nähi svataù kåñëa-jïäna
jévere kåpäya kailä kåñëa veda-puräëa
The forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their
relationship with the Supreme Lord, an d they are engrossed in thinking of
material activities. Just to transfer th eir thinking power to the spiritual sky,
Kåñëa-dvaipäyana Vyäsa has gi ven a great number of Vedic literatures. First he
divided the Vedas  into four, then he explained them in the Puräëas,  and for
less capable people he wrote the Mahäbhärata.  In the Mahäbhärata  there is
given the Bhagavad-gétä.  Then all Vedic literature is su mmarized in the
Vedänta-sütra,  and for future guidance he ga ve a natural commentation on the
Vedänta-sütra,  called Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  We must always engage our minds
in reading these Vedic literatures. Just  as materialists engage their minds in
reading new spapers, magazines and so many materialistic literatures, we must
transfer our reading to these literatures which are given to us by Vyäsadeva; in
that way it will be possible for us to re member the Supreme Lord at the time of
death. That is the only way s uggested by the Lord, and He guarantees the
result: “There is no doubt.”

“Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Kåñëa
and at the same time continue your prescribed duty of fighting. With your
activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you
will attain Me without doubt.” ( Bg. 8.7)
H e  d o e s  n o t  a d v i s e  A r j u n a  s i m p l y  to remember Him and give up his
occupation. No, the Lord never suggests an ything impractical. In this material
world, in order to maintain the bo dy one has to work. Human society is
divided, according to work, into four div isions of social order— brähmaëa,
kñatriya, vaiçya  and çüdra.  The brähmaëa  class or intelligent class is working in
one way, the kñatriya  or administrative class is working in another way, andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the mercantile class and the labo rers are all tending to their s pecific duties. In
the human society, whether one is a laborer, merchant, administrator or
farmer, or even if one belongs to the highest class and is a literary man, a
scientist or a theologian, he has to wo rk in order to maintain his existence.
The Lord t herefore tells Arjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but
while he is engaged in his occupa tion he should remember Kåñëa ( mäm
anusmara [Bg. 8.7]). If he doesn’t practice remembering Kåñëa while he is
struggling for existence, then it will not be p ossible for him to remember Kåñëa
at the time of death. Lord Cait anya also advises this. He says, kértanéyaù sadä
hariù:  [Cc. adi 17.31 ] one should practice chanting the names of the Lord
always. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord  Kåñëa’s
instructions to Arjuna to “remember Me” and Lord Caitanya’s injunction to
“always chant the names of Lord Kåñëa” are the same instruction. There is no
difference, because Kåñëa and Kåñëa’s name are nondifferent. In the absolute
status there is no difference between reference and referrent. Therefore we
have to practice remembering the Lord  always, twenty-four hours a day, by
chanting His names and molding our life’s activities in such a way that we can
remember Him always.
How is this possible? The äcäryas  give the following example. If a married
woman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman
other than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One
with such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is
thinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is
carrying out her household chores. In fa ct, she carries out her household work
even more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly,
we should always remember the supreme lover, Çré Kåñëa, and at the same time
perform our material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here.
If we have a strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can di scharge
our duty and at the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that
sense of love. Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Kåñëa; he was the
constant companion of Kåñëa, and at the same time he was a warrior. Kåñëa
did not advise him to gi ve up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When
Lord Kåñëa delineates the yoga system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practiceCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.of this system is not possible for him.
arjuna uväca
yo ’yaà yogas tvayä proktaù
sämyena madhusüdana
etasyähaà na paçyämi
caïcalatvät sthitià sthiräm
“Arjuna said: O Madhusüdana, the system of yoga which You have
summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is
restless and unsteady.” ( Bg. 6.33)
But the Lord says:
yoginäm api sarveñäà
mad-gatenäntarätmanä
çraddhävän bhajate yo mäà
sa me yuktatamo mataù
“Of all yogés,  the one with great faith who alwa ys abides in Me, thinks of Me
within himself, and renders transcendental loving service to Me is the most
intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. That is My
opinion.” ( Bg. 6.47) So one wh o thinks of the Supreme Lord always is the
greatest yogé, the supermost jïäné,  and the greatest devotee at the same time.
The Lord further tells Arjuna that as a kñatriya  he cannot give up his fighting,
but if Arjuna fights remembering Kåñëa, then he will be able to remember
Kåñëa at the time of death. But one mu s t  b e  c o m p l e t e l y  s u r r e n d e r e d  i n  t h e
transcendental loving service of the Lord.
We work not with our body, actually , but with our mind and intelligence.
So if the intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought of the
Supreme Lord, then naturally the senses are also engaged in His service.
Superficially, at least, the acti vities of the senses remain the same, but the
consciousness is changed. The Bhagavad-gétä  teaches one how to absorb the
mind and intelligence in the thought of  the Lord. Such absorption will enable
one to transfer himself to the kingdom of the Lord. If the  mind is engaged in
Kåñëa’s service, then the senses are au tomatically engaged in His service. ThisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.is the art, and this is also the secret of Bhagavad-gétä:  total absorption in the
thought of Çré Kåñëa.
Modern man has struggled very hard to reach the moon, but he has not
tried very hard to elevate himself spiritually. If one has fifty years of life ahead
o f  h i m ,  h e  s h o u l d  e n g a g e  t h a t  b r i e f  time in cultivating this practice of
remembering the Supreme Perso nality of Godhead. This practice is the
devotional process:
çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù
smaraëaà päda-sevanam
arcanaà vandanaà däsyaà
sakhyam ätma-nivedanam
(Çrémad-Bhägavatam  7.5.23 )
These nine processes, of which the easiest is çravaëam,  hearing the
Bhagavad-gétä  from the realized person, will turn one to the thought of the
Supreme Being. This will lead to re membering the Supreme Lord and will
enable one, upon leaving the body, to att ain a spiritual body which is just fit
for association with the Supreme Lord.
The Lord further says:
abhyäsa-yoga-yuktena
cetasä nänya-gäminä
paramaà puruñaà divyaà
yäti pärthänucintayan
“He who meditates on Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind
constantly engaged in remembering Me , undeviated from the path, he, O
Arjuna, is sure to reach Me.” ( Bg. 8.8)
This is not a very difficult process.  However, one must learn it from an
experienced person. Tad vijïänärthaà sa gurum eväbhigac chet: [MU  1.2.12(3) ]
one must approach a person who is alre ady in the practice. The mind is always
flying to this and that, but one  must practice concentrating the mind always
on the form of the Supreme Lord, Çré Kå ñëa, or on the sound of His name. The
mind is naturally restless, going hither and thither, but it can rest in the soundCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.vibration of Kåñëa. One must thus meditate on param aà puruñam,  the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in the spiritual kingdom, the spiritual sky,
and thus attain Him. The ways and the means for ultimate realization,
ultimate attainment, are stated in the Bhagavad-gétä,  and the doors of this
knowledge are open  for everyone. No one is barred out. All classes of men can
approach Lord Kåñëa by thinking of Hi m, for hearing and thinking of Him is
possible for everyone.
The Lord further says ( Bg. 9.32–33 ):
mäà hi pärtha vyapäçritya
ye ’pi syuù päpa-yonayaù
striyo vaiçyäs tathä çüdräs
te ’pi yänti paräà gatim
kià punar brähmaëäù puëyä
bhaktä räjarñayas tathä
anityam asukhaà lokam
imaà präpya bhajasva mäm
Thus the Lord says that even a me rchant, a fallen woman or a laborer or
even human beings in the lowest status  of life can attain the Supreme. One
does not need highly developed intelli gence. The point is that anyone who
accepts the principle of bhakti-yog a and accepts the Supreme Lord as the
summum bonum  of life, as the highest target, the ultimate goal, can approach
the Lord in the spiritual sky. If one adopts the principles enunciated in
Bhagavad-gétä,  he can make his life perfect and make a permanent so lution to
all the problems of life. This is the sum and substance of the entire
Bhagavad-gétä.
In conclusion, Bhagavad-gétä  is a transcendental literature which one
should read very carefully. Gétä-çästram idaà puëyaà yaù paöhet prayataù
pumän:  if one properly follows the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä,  one can be
freed from all the miseries and anxi eties of life. Bhaya-çokädi-varjitaù.  One will

(Gétä-mähätmya  2) The Lord says very loudly in the last portion of

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall

person against all reactions of si ns.

the original Viñëu.” ( Gétä-mähätmya  5) Bhagavad-gétä  comes from the mouth
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,  and the Ganges is said to emanate
from the lotus feet of the Lord. Of course, there is no difference between the
mouth and the feet of the Supreme Lord, but from an impartial stu dy we can
appreciate that Bhagavad-gétä  is even more important than the water of the
Ganges.

TRANSLATION
Dhåtaräñöra said: O Saïjaya, after my sons and the sons of Päëòu assembled
in the place of pilgrimage at Kurukñetra, desiring to fight, what did they do?
PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Bhagavad-gétä  is the widely read theistic science summarized in the
Gétä-mähätmya  (Glorification of the Gétä ). There it says that one should read
Bhagavad-gétä  very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of
Çré Kåñëa and try to understan d it without personally motivated
interpretations. The example of cl ear understanding is there in the
Bhagavad-gétä  itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who
heard the Gétä directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to
unders tand Bhagavad-gétä  in that line of disciplic succession, without
motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all
scriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-gétä  all that is contained
in other scriptures, but the  reader will also find things which are not to be
found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the Gétä.  It is the perfect
theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa.
The topics discussed by Dhåtaräñöra and Saïjaya, as described in the
Mahäbhärata,  form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is
understood that this philosophy evol ved on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra,
which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from  the immemorial time of the Vedic
age. It was spoken by the Lord when He  was present personally on this planet
for the guidance of mankind.
The word dharma-kñetra  (a place where religious rituals are performed) is
significant because, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dhåtaräñöra, the father of the
Kurus, was highly doubtful  about the possibility of his sons’ ultimate victory. In
his doubt, he inquired from his secretar y Saïjaya, “What did they do?” He was
confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother Päëòu were
assembled in that Field of Kurukñetra for a d etermined engagement of the war.
Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the
cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the
battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kurukñet ra, which
is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas  as a place of worship—even for the
denizens of heaven—Dhåtaräñöra became  very fearful about the influence of
the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this wouldCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.influence Arjuna and t he sons of Päëòu favorably, because by nature they
were all virtuous. Saïjaya was a student of Vyäsa, and therefore, by the mercy
of Vyäsa, Saïjaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kurukñetra even while
he was in the room of Dhåtaräñöra. And so, Dhå taräñöra asked him about the
situation on the battlefield.
Both the Päëòavas and the sons of Dh åtaräñöra belong to the same family,
but Dhåtaräñöra’s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his
sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of Päëòu from the family heritage.
One can thus understand the sp ecific position of Dhåtaräñöra in his
relationship with his nephews, the sons  o f  P ä ë ò u .  A s  i n  t h e  p a d d y  f i e l d  t h e
unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of
these topics that in the religi ous field of Kurukñetra, where t he father of
religion, Çré Kåñëa, was present, the unwanted plants like Dhåtaräñöra’s son
Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious
persons, headed by Yudhiñöhira, would be established by the Lord. This is the
significance of th e words dharma-kñetre  and kuru-kñetre,  apart from their
historical and Vedic importance.

Saïjaya said: O King, after looking over the army arranged in military
formation by the sons of Päëòu, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and
spoke the following words.
PURPORT
Dhåtaräñöra was blind from birth. Un fortunately, he was also bereft of
spiritual vision. He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the
matter of religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an
understanding with the Päëòavas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was
doubtful about the influence of the pl ace of pilgrimage, and Saïjaya could
understand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield. Saïjaya
wanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent king and thus assu red him
that his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the
influence of the holy place. Saïjaya th erefore informed the king that his son,
Duryodhana, after seeing the military fo rce of the Päëòavas, at once went to
the commander in chief , Droëäcärya, to inform him of the real position.
Although Duryodhana is mentioned as the king, he still had to go to the
commander on account of the seriousne ss of the situation. He was therefore
quite fit to be a politician. But Duryodhana’s diplomatic v eneer could not
disguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrangement of the
Päëòavas.

O my teacher, behold the great army of the sons of Päëòu, so expertly

PURPORT
Duryodhana, a great diplomat, wanted to point out the defects of
Droëäcärya, the great brähmaëa  commander in chief. Droëäcärya had some
political quarrel with King Drupada, th e father of Draupadé, who was Arjuna’s
wife. As a result of this quarrel, Drupada  performed a great sacrifice, by which
he received the benediction of havi ng a son who would be able to kill
Droëäcärya. Droëäcärya knew this perfectly well, and yet as a liberal
brähmaëa  he did not hesitate to impart a ll his military secrets when the son of
Drupada, Dhåñöadyumna, was entrusted to him for military education. Now, on
the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, Dhåñöady umna took the side of the Päëòavas,
and it was he who arranged for their military phalanx, after having learned the
art from Droëäcärya. D uryodhana pointed out this mistake of Droëäcärya’s so
that he might be alert and uncompromisi ng in the fighting. By this he wanted
to point out also that he should not be  similarly lenient in battle against theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Päëòavas, who were also Droëäcärya’s affectio nate students. Arjuna,
especially, was his most affectionate and brilliant student. Duryodhana also
warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat.

Even though Dhåñöadyumna was not a very important obstacle in the face
of Droëäcärya’s very great power in th e military art, there were many others
who were causes of fear. They are mentioned by Duryodhana as great
stumbling blocks on the path of victory b ecause each and every one of them
was as formidable as Bhéma and Arjuna . He knew the strength of Bhéma and
Arjuna, and thus he compared the others with them.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  5

Kurukñetra for joining the party o f the sinful Duryodhana. Duryodhana was, of

Herein an estimation of comparative strength is made by Duryodhana. He
thinks that the strength of his armed forces is immeasurable, being specifically
protected by the most experienced gene ral, Grandfather Bhéñma. On the other
hand, the forces of the Päëò avas are limited, being protected by a less
experienced general, Bhéma, who is like a fig in the presence of Bhéñma.
Duryodhana was always envious of Bhém a because he knew perfectly well that
if he should die at all, he would only be killed by Bhéma. But a t the same time,
he was confident of his victory on account of the presence of Bhéñma, who was
a far superior general. His conclusion that he would come out of the battle
victorious was well ascertained.

All of you must now give full support to Grandfather Bhéñma, as you stand

PURPORT
Duryodhana, after praising the prowess of Bhéñma, further considered that
others might think that they had been considered less important, so in his
usual diplomatic way, he tried to adjust the situation in the above words. He
emphasized that Bhéñmadeva wa s undoubtedly the greatest hero, but he was an
old man, so everyone must especially think of his protection from all sides. He
might become engaged in the fight, and the enemy might take advantage of his
full engagement on one side. Therefore, it was impor tant that other heroes not
leave their strategic positions and a llow the enemy to break the phalanx.
Duryodhana clearly felt that the vi ctory of the Kurus depended on the
presence of Bhéñmadeva. He was confid ent of the full support of Bhéñmadeva
and Droëäc ärya in the battle because he we ll knew that they did not even
speak a word when Arjuna’s wife Draupadé, in her helpless condition, had
appealed to them for justice while she wa s being forced to appear naked in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.presence of all the great generals in the  assembly. Although he knew that the
two generals had some sort of affectio n for the Päëòavas, he hoped that these
generals would now completely give it  up, as they had done during the
gambling performances.

The grandsire of the Kuru dynasty could understand the inner meaning of
the heart of his grandson Duryodhana, and out of his natural compassion for
him he tried to cheer him by blowing hi s conchshell very loudly, befitting hisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.position as a lion. Indirectl y, by the symbolism of the conchshell, he informed
his depressed grandson Duryodhana that he had no chance of victory in the
battle, because the Supreme Lord Kåñëa wa s on the other side. But still, it was
his duty to conduct the fight, and no pains would b e spared in that connection.

TRANSLATION
On the other side, both Lord Kåñëa and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot
drawn by white horses, sounded th eir transcendental conchshells.
PURPORT
In contrast with the conchshell blow n by Bhéñmadeva, the conchshells in
the hands of Kåñëa and Arjuna are described as transcendental. The sounding
of the transcendental conchshells indica ted that there was no hope of victory
for the other side because Kåñ ëa was on the side of the Päëòavas. Jayas tu
päëòu-puträëäà yeñäà pakñe janärdanaù.  Victory is always with persons like
the sons of Päëòu because Lord Kåñëa is associated with them. And whenever
and wherever the Lord is presen t, the goddess of fortune is a lso there because
the goddess of fortune never lives al one without her husband. Therefore,
victory and fortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental
sound produced by the conchshell of Viñë u, or Lord Kåñëa. Besides that, the
chariot on w hich both the friends were seated  had been donated by Agni (the
fire-god) to Arjuna, and this indica ted that this chariot was capable of
conquering all sides, wherever it was drawn over the three worlds.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  15

TRANSLATION
Lord Kåñëa blew His conchshell, called Päïcajanya; Arjuna blew his, the
Devadatta; and Bhéma, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks,
blew his terrific conchshell, called Pauëòra.
PURPORT
Lord Kåñëa is referred to as Håñékeça in this verse because He is the owner
of all senses. The living entities are pa rt and parcel of Him, and therefore the
senses of the living entities are also  part and parcel of His senses. The
impersonalists cannot acc ount for the senses of the living entities, and
therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless, or
impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hear ts of all living entities, directs their
senses. But He directs in terms of the sur render of the living entity, and in theCopyright  © 1998 The  Bhaktivedanta Book  Trust  Int'l.  All Rights Reserved.case of a pure devotee He directly cont rols the senses. Here on the Battlefield
of Kurukñetra the Lord directly controls  the transcendental senses of Arjuna,
and thus His particular name of Håñékeça. The Lord has dif ferent names
according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhusüdana
because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda
because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is Väsudeva
because He appeared as  the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devaké-nandana
because He accepted Devaké as His mother; His name is Yaçodä-nandana
because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Yaçodä at Våndävana; His
name is Pärtha-särathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend  Arjuna.
Similarly, His name is Håñékeça because He gave direction to Arjuna on the
Battlefield of Kurukñetra.
Arjuna is referred to as Dhanaïjaya in this verse because he helped his
elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required  by the king to make
expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bhéma is known as Våkodara
because he could eat as voracious ly as he could perform herculean tasks, such
as killing the demon Hiòimba. So the particular types of conchshell blown by
the different personalities on the side of the Päëòavas, beginning with the
Lord’s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers . On the other side
there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord Kåñëa, the supreme
director, nor that of the goddess of fort une. So they were predestined to lose
the battle—and that was the message announced by the sounds of the
conchshells.

PURPORT
Saïjaya informed King Dhåtaräñöra very  tactfully that his unwise policy of
deceiving the sons of Päëòu and endeavor ing to enthrone his own sons on the
seat of the kingdom was not very laudab le. The signs already clearly indicated
that the whole Kuru dynast y would be killed in that great battle. Beginning
with the grandsire, Bhéñma, down to the grandsons like Abhimanyu and
others—including kings from many states of the world—all were present
there, and all were doomed. The whole catastrophe was due to King
Dhåtaräñöra, because he encouraged the policy followed by his sons.

The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious. Vibrating
both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of
Dhåtaräñöra.
PURPORT
When Bhéñma and the others on th e side of Duryodhana blew their
respective conchshells, there was no heart-breaking on the part of the
Päëòavas. Such occurrences are not mentio ned, but in this particular verse it
is mentioned that the hearts of the sons of  Dhåtaräñöra were shattered by the
sounds vibrated by the Päëòavas’ party. This is due to the Päëòavas and their
confidence in Lord Kåñëa. One who ta kes shelter of the Supreme Lord has
nothing to fear, even in the midst of the greatest calamity.

At that time Arjuna, the son of Päëòu, seated in the chariot bearing the flag
marked with Hanumän, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows. O
King, after looking at the sons of Dhåtaräñöra drawn in military array, Arjuna
then spoke to Lord Kåñëa t hese words.
PURPORT
The battle was just about to begin. It is understood from the above
statement that the sons of Dhåtaräñöra were more or less disheartened by the
unexpected arrangement of military fo rce by the Päëòavas, who were guided
by the direct instructions of Lord Kå ñëa on the battlefield. The emblem of
Hanumän on the flag of Arjuna is an other sign of victory because Hanumän
cooperated with Lord Räma in the battle between Räma and Rävaëa, and Lord
Räma emerged victorious. Now both Räma and Hanumän were present on the
chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord Kåñëa is Räma Himself, and wherever
Lord Räma is, His eternal servitor Ha numän and His eternal consort Sétä, the
goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any
enemies whatsoever. And above a ll, the Lord of the senses, Lord Kåñëa, was
personally present to give him directio n. Thus, all good counsel was available
to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions,
arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the  signs of assured victory.

Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies
so that I may see those present here, who desire to fight, and with whom I must
contend in this great trial of arms.
PURPORT
Although Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His
causeless mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend. He never fails in
His affection for His devotees, and thus He  is addressed herein as infallible. As
charioteer, He had to car ry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did notCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted the
position of a charioteer for His de votee, His supreme position was not
challenged. In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead,
Håñékeça, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and
His servitor is very sweet and transcen dental. The servitor is always ready to
render service to the Lord, and, simi larly, the Lord is always seeking an
oppor tunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in
His pure devotee’s assuming the advant ageous position of ordering Him than
He does in being the giver of orders. Si nce He is master, everyone is under His
orders, and no one is abov e Him to order Him. But when He finds that a pure
devotee is ordering Him, He obtains tr anscendental pleasure, although He is
the infallible master of all circumstances.
As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna  had no desire to fight with his
cousins and brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the
obstinacy of Duryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful
negotiation. Therefore, he was very anxious t o see who the leading persons
present on the battlefield were. Although there was no question of a
peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield , he wanted to see them again, and to
see how much they were bent upon demanding an unwanted war.

PURPORT
It was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the
Päëòavas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dhåtaräñöra.
Therefore, all persons who had joined th e side of Duryodhana must have been
birds of the same feather. Arjuna wa nted to see them on the battlefield before
the fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of
proposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a fact that he wanted to
see them to make an estimate of the strength which he had t o face, although
he was quite confident of victory because Kåñëa was sitting by his side.

TRANSLATION
Saïjaya said: O descendant of Bharata, having thus been addressed by
Arjuna, Lord Kåñëa drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both
parties.
PURPORT
In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Guòäkeça. Guòäkä  means sleep, and
one who conquers sleep is called guòäkeça.  Sleep also means ignorance. So
Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with
Kåñëa. As a great devotee of Kåñëa, he could not forget Kåñëa even for a
moment, because that is the nature of a de votee. Either in waking or in sleep, a
devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of Kåñëa’s name, form,
qualities and pastimes. Thus a de votee of Kåñëa can conquer bot h sleep and
ignorance simply by thinking of Kå ñëa constantly. This is called Kåñëa
consciousness, or samädhi.  As Håñékeça, or the director of the senses and mind
of every living entity, Kåñëa could unde rstand Arjuna’s purpose in placing the
chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows.

In the presence of Bhéñma, Droëa and all the other chieftains of the world,
the Lord said, Just behold, Pärtha, all the Kurus assembled here.
PURPORT
As the Supersoul of all living entiti es, Lord Kåñëa could understand what
was going on in the mind of Arjuna. The use of the word Håñékeça in this
connection indicates that He knew ever ything. And the word Pärtha, or the
son of Kunté, or Påthä, is also sim ilarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a
friend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of Påthä,
the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of
Arjuna. Now what did Kåñëa mean when He told Arjuna to  “behold the
Kurus”? Did Arjuna want to stop ther e and not fight? Kåñëa never expected
such things from the son of His aunt Påthä. The mind of Arjuna was thus
predicted by the Lord in friendly joking.

PURPORT
Any man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities
which are found in godly persons or in  the demigods, whereas the nondevotee,
however advanced he may be in mater ial qualifications by education and
culture, lacks in godly qualities. A s such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen,
friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by
compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as
his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the begin ning, but he
felt compassion even for the soldiers of  the opposite party, foreseeing their
imminent death. And while he was so th inking, the limbs of his body began to
quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their
fighting s pirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna,
had come to fight with him. This ov erwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna.
Although it is not mentioned here, sti ll one can easily imagine that not only
were Arjuna’s bodily limbs quiveri ng and his mouth drying up, but he was also
crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness
but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is
said therefore:

hovering on the mental pl ane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring
material energy.” ( Bhäg.  5.18.12 )

PURPORT
There are two kinds of trembling of the body, and two kinds of standings of
the hair on end. Such phenomena occur ei ther in great spiritual ecstasy or out
of great fear under material conditions . There is no fear in transcendental
realization. Arjuna’s sym ptoms in this situation are out of material
fear—namely, loss of life. This is evid ent from other symptoms also; he became
so impatient that his famous bow Gäëòéva was slipping from his hands, and,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.because his heart was burning wi thin him, he was feeling a  burning sensation
of the skin. All these are due to a material conception of life.

demon.
PURPORT
Due to his impatience, Arjuna was unable to stay on the battlefield, and he
was forgetting himself on account of  this weakness of his mind. Excessive
attachment for material things puts a man in such a bewildering condition of
existence. Bhayaà dvitéyäbhin iveçataù syät  (Bhäg.  11.2.37 ): such fearfulness and
loss of mental equilibrium take plac e in persons who are too affected by
material conditions. Arjuna envisioned only painful reverses in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.battlefield—he would not be happy even by gaining victory over the foe. The
words nimittäni viparétäni  are significant. When a man sees only frustration in
his expectations, he thinks, “Why am I he re?” Everyone is interested in himself
and his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is
showing ig norance of his real self-interest by Kåñëa’s will. One’s real
self-interest lies in Viñëu, or Kåñëa.  The conditioned soul forgets this, and
therefore suffers material pains. Arjuna  thought that his victory in the battle
would only be a cause of lamentation  for him.

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Without knowing that one’s self-i nterest is in Viñëu (or Kåñëa),
conditioned souls are attracted by bodily  relationships, hoping to be happy in
such situations. In such a blind concepti on of life, they forget even the causes
of material happiness. Arjuna a ppears to have even forgotten the moral codes
for a kñatriya.  It  is said t h at  t wo kinds of m en, nam ely t h e kñatriya  who dies
directly in front of the battlefield under Kåñëa’s personal orders and the
person in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual
culture, are eligible to enter into th e sun globe, which is so powerful and
dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant even to ki ll his enemies, let alone his relatives. He
thinks that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life,  and
therefore he is not willing to fight, just  as a person who does not feel hunger is
not inclined to cook. He has now decide d to go into the forest and live a
secluded life in frustration. But as a kñatriya,  he requires a kingdom for his
subsistence, be cause the kñatriyas  cannot engage themselves in any other
occupation. But Arjuna has no kingdom. Arjuna’s sole opportunity for gaining
a kingdom lies in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the
kingdom inherited from his father, which he d oes not like to do. Therefore he
considers himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.

TRANSLATION
O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness or even life itself
when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this
battlefield? O Madhusüdana, when te achers, fathers, sons, grandfathers,
maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandson s, brothers-in-law and other relatives
are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, why
should I wish to kill them, even though they might otherwise kill me? O
maintainer of all living entities, I am not prepared to fight wit h them even in
exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth. What pleasure will we derive
from killing the sons of Dhåtaräñöra?
PURPORT
Arjuna has addressed Lord Kåñëa as Govinda because Kåñëa is the object of
all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna
indicates that Kåñëa should understand what will satisfy Arjuna’s senses. But
Govinda is not meant for s atisfying our senses. If we try to satisfy the senses of
Govinda, however, then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially,
everyone wants to satisfy his senses, an d he wants God to be the order supplier
for such satisfaction. The Lord will sat isfy the senses of the living entities as
much as they deserve, but not to the ex tent that they may covet. But when one
takes the opposite way—namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of
Govinda without desiring to satisfy one’s own senses—then by the grace of
Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna’s deep affection
for community and family members is exhi bited here partly due to his natural
compassion for them. He is therefore no t prepared to fight. Everyone wants to
show his opu lence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his
relatives and friends will be killed on the battlefield and he will be unable to
share his opulence after victory. This is  a typical calculation of material life.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The transcendental life, howeve r, is different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy
the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for
the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a
farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his rela tives, and if there were any need
to kill them, he desired that Kåñëa kill them personally. At this point he did
not know that Kåñëa had already killed them before their coming into the
battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for Kåñëa. Th is fact
is disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did
not like to retaliate against his miscre ant cousins and brothers, but it was the
L o r d ’ s  p l a n  t h a t  t h e y  s h o u l d  a l l  b e  k i lled. The devotee of the Lord does not
retaliate  against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief
done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His
own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees.
Therefore the Lord was determined to kill t he miscreants, although Arjuna
wanted to excuse them.

Sin will overcome us if we slay such a ggressors. Therefore it is not proper for
us to kill the sons of Dhåtaräñöra and our friends. What should we gain, O
Kåñëa, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing
our own kinsmen?
PURPORT
According to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: (1) a
poison giver, (2) one who sets fire to the house, (3) one who attacks with
deadly weapons, (4) one who plunders riches, (5) one who occupies another’s
land, and (6) one who kidnaps a w ife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed,
and no sin is incurred by killing such a ggressors. Such killing of aggressors is
quite befitting any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He
was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to  deal with them in
saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a kñatriya.  Although a
responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he
should not be cowardly. For example, Lord Räma was so saintly that people
even now are anxious to live in the kingdom of Lord Räma ( räma-räjya ), but
Lord Räma never showed any cowardice. Rävaëa was an aggressor against
Räma because Rävaëa kidnapped Räma’s wife, Sétä, but Lord Räma gave him
sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the h i s t o r y  o f  t h e  w o r l d .  I n  A r j u n a ’ s  c a s e ,
however, one should consider the special  type of aggressors, namely his own
grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them,
Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary a gainst
ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such
injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any politicalCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for
political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and
saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply
for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and
pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so wh y should he risk his life
and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna’s addressing of Kåñëa
as “Mädhava,” or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in
this connection. He wanted to point out to Kåñëa that, as husband of the
goddess of fortune, He should not indu ce Arjuna to take up a matter which
would ultimately bring about misfortune. Kåñëa, however, never brings
misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.

PURPORT
A kñatriya  is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so
invited by some rival party. Under such  an obligation, Arjuna could not refuse
to fight, because he had been challeng ed by the party of Duryodhana. In this
connection, Arjuna considered  that the other party might be blind to the
effects of such a challenge. Arjuna, however, could see the evil consequences
and could not accept the challenge. Obli gation is actually binding when the
effect is good, but when the effect is otherwise, then no one can be bound.
Considering all these pros and cons, Arjuna decided not to fight.

In the system of the varëäçrama  institution there are many principles of
religious traditions to help members of  the family grow properly and attain
spiritual values. The elder members are re sponsible for such purifying processes
in the family, beginning f rom birth to death. But on the death of the elder
members, such family traditions of pu rification may stop, and the remaining
younger family members may develop irreligious habits and thereby lose their
chance for spiritual salvation. Therefore, for no pur pose should the elder
members of the family be slain.

When irreligion is prominent in the family, O Kåñëa, the women of the
family become polluted, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant
of Våñëi, comes unwanted progeny.
PURPORT
Good population in human society is the basic principle for peace,
prosperity and spiritual progress in life. The varëäçrama  religion’s principles
were so designed that the good popula tion would prevail in society for the
general spiritual progress of stat e and community. Such population depends on
the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to
be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both
children and women require protection by the elder members o f the family. By
being engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into
adultery. According to Cäëakya Paëòita, women are generally not very
intelligent and therefore not trustworthy.  So the different family traditions of
religious act ivities should always engage th em, and thus their chastity and
devotion will give birth to a good popula tion eligible for participating in the
varëäçrama  system. On the failure of such varëäçrama-dharma,  naturally the
women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in
at the risk of unwanted population. I rresponsible men also provoke adultery in
society, and thus unwanted children fl ood the human race at the risk of war
and pestilence.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  41

An increase of unwanted population certainly causes hellish life both for the

water are entirely st opped.
PURPORT
According to the rules and regulations of  fruitive activities, there is a need
to offer periodical food and water to  the forefathers of the family. This
offering is performed by worship of Viñëu, because eating the remnants of food
offered to Viñëu can del iver one from all kinds of sinful actions. Sometimes
the forefathers may be suffering from va rious types of sinful reactions, and
sometimes some of them cannot even ac quire a gross material body and are
forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, wh en remnants of prasädamCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.food are offered to forefathers by de scendants, the forefathers are released
from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers
is a family tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are requir ed to
perform such rituals. One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required
to perform such actions. Simply by performing devotional service, one can
deliver hundreds and thousands of forefa thers from all kinds of misery. It is
stated in the Bhäg avatam  (11.5.41 ):

“Anyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, the giver of
liberation, giving up all kinds of obliga tion, and has taken to the path in all
seriousness, owes neither duties nor obligations to the demigods, sages, general
living entities, famil y members, humankind or forefathers.” Such obligations
are automatically fulfilled by performance of devotional service to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

O Kåñëa, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that
those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell.
PURPORT
Arjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience, but on what
he has heard from the authorities. That is the way of receiving real knowledge.
One cannot reach the real point of fact ual knowledge without being helped by
the right person who is a lready established in that knowledge. There is a
system in the varëäçrama  institution by which before death one has to undergo
the process of atonement for his sinful activities. One who is always engaged in
sinful activities must utilize the process of at onement called the präyaçcitta.
Without doing so, one surely will be tran sferred to hellish planets to undergo
miserable lives as the result of sinful activities.

Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts.

kinsmen.
PURPORT
Driven by selfish motives, one may be inclined to such sinful acts as the
killing of one’s own brother, father or mother. There are many such instances
in the history of the world. But Arjuna, being a saintly devotee of the Lord, is
always conscious of mor al principles and therefore takes care to avoid such
activities.

PURPORT
It is the custom—according to kñatriya  fighting principles—that an
unarmed and unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, decided
that even if attacked by the enemy in such an awkward position, he would not
fight. He did not consider how much t he other party was bent upon fighting.
All these symptoms are due to soft-heart edness resulting from his being a great
devotee of the Lord.

PURPORT
While observing the situation of his en emy, Arjuna stood up on the chariot,
but he was so afflicted with lamentatio n that he sat down again, setting aside
his bow and arrows. Such a kind and so ft-hearted person, in the devotional
service of the Lord, is fi t to receive self-knowledge.

Saïjaya said: Seeing Arjuna full of co mpassion, his mind depressed, his eyes
full of tears, Madhusüdana, Kåñëa, spoke the following words.
PURPORT
Material compassion, lamentation and te ars are all signs of ignorance of the
real self. Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization. The word
“Madhusüdana” is significant in this  verse. Lord Kåñëa killed the demon
Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted Kåñëa  to kill the demon of misunderstanding
that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where
compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is
senseless. A man fallen in the ocea n of nescience cannot be saved sim ply by
rescuing his outward dress—the gross material body. One who does not know
this and laments for the outward dress is called a çüdra,  or one who laments
unnecessarily. Arjuna was a kñatriya,  and this conduct was not expected from
him. Lord Kåñëa, howe ver, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man,
and for this purpose the Bhagavad-gétä  was sung by Him. This chapter instructs
us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit
soul, as explained by the supreme autho rity, Lord Çré Kåñëa. This realization is
possible when one works without attachment  to fruitive results and is situated
in the fixed conception of the real self.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  2

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, how have these
impurities come upon you? They are no t at all befitting a man who knows the
value of life. They lead not to higher planets but to infamy.
PURPORT
Kåñëa and the Supreme Personality of  Godhead are identical. Therefore
Lord Kåñëa is referred to as Bhagavän throughout the Gétä.  Bhagavän is the
ultimate in the Absolute Truth. Absolute  Truth is realized in three phases of
understanding, namely Brahman, or  the impersonal all-pervasive spirit;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Paramätmä, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all
living entities; and Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord
Kåñëa. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.11 ) this conception of the Absol ute
Truth is explained thus:
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvaà yaj jïänam advayam
brahmeti paramätmeti
bhagavän iti çabdyate
“The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the
knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of
the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramätmä, and Bhagavän.”
These three divine aspects can be ex plained by the example of the sun,
which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun’s surface
and the sun planet itself. One who studie s the sunshine only is the preliminary
student. One who understan ds the sun’s surface is further advanced. And one
who can enter into the sun planet is th e highest. Ordinary students who are
satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine—its universal pervasiveness
and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature—may  be compared to those
who can realize only the Brahman featur e of the Absolute Truth. The student
who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to
knowledge of the Paramätmä feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student
who can e nter into the heart of the sun pl anet is compared to those who
realize the personal features of the Su preme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the
bhaktas,  or the transcendentalists who have  realized the Bhagavän feature of
the Absolute Truth, are the topmost tran scendentalists, although all students
who are engaged in the study of the Ab solute Truth are engaged in the same
subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun
planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students o f the three
different phases are not in the same category.
The Sanskrit word bhagavän  is explained by the great authority Paräçara
Muni, the father of Vyäsadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all
riches, all strength, all fame, all beau ty, all knowledge and all renunciation isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.called Bhagavän. There are ma ny persons who are very rich, very powerful,
very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one
can claim that he possesses all riches, a ll strength, etc., entirely. Only Kåñëa
can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality  of Godhead. No living
entity, including Brahmä, Lord Çiva, or Näräyaëa, can possess opulences as
fully as Kåñëa. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-saàhitä  by Lord
Brahmä himself that Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No
one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavän, known as
Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes:
éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù
sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù
anädir ädir govindaù
sarva-käraëa-käraëam
“There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavän, but
Kåñëa is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person,
and His body is eternal, full of knowle dge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord
Govinda and the cause of all ca uses.” ( Brahma-saàhitä  5.1)
In the Bhägavatam  also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but Kåñëa is described as the original Personality of
Godhead, from whom many, many incarn ations and Personalities of Godhead
expand:
ete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù
kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam
indräri-vyäkulaà lokaà
måòayanti yuge yuge
“All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either
plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme
Godhead, but Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.” ( Bhäg.
1.3.28 )
Therefore, Kåñëa is the original Su preme Personality of Godhead, the
Absolute Truth, the source of bo th the Supersoul and the impersonalCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Brahman.
In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna’s
lamentation for his kinsmen is certain ly unbecoming, and therefore. Kåñëa
expressed His surprise with the word kutaù,  “wherefrom.” Such impurities were
never expected from a person belonging t o the civilized class of men known as
Äryans. The word Äryan  is applicable to persons who know the value of life
and have a civilization based on spirit ual realization. Persons who are led by
the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life  is realization of
the Absolute Truth, Viñëu, or Bhagav än, and they are captivated by the
external features of the material worl d, and therefore they do not know what
liberation is. Persons who have no kn owledge of liberation from material
bondage are call ed non-Äryans. Although Arjuna was a kñatriya,  he was
deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of
cowardice is described as befitting th e non-Äryans. Such deviation from duty
does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the
opportunity to become famous in this wo rld. Lord Kåñëa did not approve of the
so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.

TRANSLATION
O son of Påthä, do not yield to this degrading impotence. It does not become
you. Give up such petty weakness of he art and arise, O chastiser of the enemy.
PURPORT
Arjuna was addressed as the son of Påthä, who happened to be the sister of
Kåñëa’s father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with
Kåñëa. If the son of a kñatriya  declines to fight, he is a kñatriya  in name only,
and if the son of a brähmaë a acts impiously, he is a brähmaëa  in name only.
Such kñatriyas  and brähmaëas  are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore,
Kåñëa did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a kñatriya.  Arjuna
was the most intimate friend of Kåñëa, and Kåñëa was dire ctly guiding him on
the chariot; but in spite of all these cr edits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle he
would be committing an infamous act. Therefore Kåñëa said that such an
attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he
would gi ve up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the
most respectable Bhéñma and his relatives, but Kåñëa considered that sort of
magnanimity mere weakness of heart.  Such false magnanimity was not
approved by any authority. Therefore, such m agnanimity or so-called
nonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct
guidance of Kåñëa.

Arjuna said: O killer of enemies, O killer of Madhu, how can I

worthy of my worship?
PURPORT
Respectable superiors like Bhéñma the grandfather and Droëäcärya the
teacher are always worshipable. Even if they attack, they should not be
counterattacked. It is general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered
even a verbal fight. Even if they are  sometimes harsh in behavior, they should
not be harshly treated. Then, how is it possible for Arjuna to counterattack
them? Would Kåñëa ever attack His own grandfather, Ugrasena, or His
teacher, Sändépani Muni? These were some of the arguments offered by
Arjuna to Kåñëa.

It would be better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of
the lives of great souls who are my teache rs. Even though desiring worldly gain,
they are superiors. If they are killed, everything we enjoy will be tainted with
blood.
PURPORT
According to scriptural codes, a te acher who engages in an abominable
action and has lost his sense of discrimi nation is fit to be abandoned. Bhéñma
and Droëa were obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because of his
financial assistance, although they sh ould not have accepted such a position
simply on financial considerations. Un der the circumstances, they have lost
the respectability of teachers. But Arju na thinks that nevertheless they remain
his superiors, and therefore to enjoy material profits after killing them would
mean to enjoy spoils tainted with blood.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  6

Nor do we know which is better—conq uering them or being conquered by
them. If we killed the sons of Dhåtaräñöra, we should not care to live. Yet they
are now standing before us on the battlefield.
PURPORT
Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary
violence, although fighting is the duty of the kñatriyas,  or whether he should
refrain and live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be
his only means of subsistence. No r was there certainty of victory, because
either side might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and theirCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.cause was justified), still, if the sons of Dhåtaräñöra died in battle, it would be
very difficult to live in their absence. Under the ci rcumstances, that would be
another kind of defeat for them. All th ese considerations by Arjuna definitely
proved that not only was he a great devo tee of the Lord but he was also highly
enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desi re to
live by begging, although he was born in  the royal household, is another sign of
detachment. He was truly virtuous, as th ese qualities, combined with his faith
in the words of instruction of Çré Kåñëa (his spiritual master), indicate. It is
concluded  that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are
controlled, there is no chance of elevat ion to the platform of knowledge, and
without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. Arjuna was
competent in all these attributes, ov er and above his enormous attributes in his
material relationships.

PURPORT
By nature’s own way the complete system of material activities is a source of
perplexity for everyone. In every step  there is perplexity, and therefore it
behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper
guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to
approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life,
which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow
blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly , the world situation is such’ that
perplexities of life automatically appe ar, without our wanting such confusion.
No one wants fire, and yet it takes plac e, and we become perplexed. The Vedic
wisdom therefore advises that in  order to solve the perplexitie s of life and to
understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master
who is in the disciplic succession. A person  with a bona fide spiritual master is
supposed to know everything. One should  not, therefore, remain in material
perpl exities but should approach a spiritua l master. This is the purport of this
verse.
Who is the man in material perplexiti es? It is he who does not understand
the problems of life. In the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad  (3.8.10 ) the perplexed
man is described as follows: yo vä etad akñaraà gärgy aviditväsmäû lokät praiti sa
kåpaëaù.  “He is a miser ly man who does not solve the problems of life as a
human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without
understanding the science of self-realization.” This human form of life is a
most valuable asset for the living entity who can utilize i t for solving the
problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properlyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.is a miser. On the other hand, there is the brähmaëa,  or he who is intelligent
enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. Ya etad akñaraà
gärgi viditväsmäû lokät praiti sa brähmaëaù.
The kåpaëas,  or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly
affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life.
One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other
members, on the basis of “skin d isease.” The kåpaëa  thinks that he is able to
protect his family members from death; or the kåpaëa  thinks that his family or
society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be
found even in the lower animal s, who take care of child ren also. Being
intelligent, Arjuna could understand that  his affection for family members and
his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities.
Although he could understand that his du ty to fight was awaiting him, still, on
account of miserly weakness, he could not di scharge the duties. He is therefore
asking Lord Kåñëa, the supreme spiritua l master, to make a definite solution.
He offers himself to Kåñëa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks
between the master and th e disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk
very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. Kåñëa is therefore the
original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-gétä,  and Arjuna is the first
disciple for understanding the Gétä.  How A rjuna understands the
Bhagavad-gétä  is stated in the Gétä itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars
explain that one need not submit to Kåñëa as a person, but to “the unborn

And one w ho has no sense of this understand ing is the greatest fool in trying
to understand Bhagavad-gétä.

TRANSLATION
I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I
will not be able to dispel it even if I win a prosperous, unrivaled kingdom on
earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.
PURPORT
Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on
knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was
unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord
Çré Kåñëa. He could understand th at his so-called knowledge was useless in
driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it
was impossible for him to solve such perple xities without the help of a spiritual
master like Lord Kåñëa. Academic knowledge, scholarship,  high position, etc.,
are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can be given only by a
spiritual master like Kåñëa. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master
who is one hundred percent Kåñëa consci ous is the bona fide spiritual maste r,
for he can solve the problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is masterCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.in the science of Kåñëa consciousness, re gardless of his social position, is the
real spiritual master.
kibä vipra, kibä nyäsé, çüdra kene naya
yei kåñëa-tattva-vettä, sei ’guru’ haya
“It does not matter whether a person is a vipra  [learned scholar in Vedic
wisdom] or is born in a lower family, or  is in the renounced order of life—if he
is master in the science of Kåñëa, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual
master.” ( Caitanya-carit ämåta, Madhya  8.128 ) So without being a master in the
science of Kåñëa consciousness, no one is a bona fide spiritual master. It is also
said in Vedic literature:
ñaö-karma-nipuëo vipro
mantra-tantra-viçäradaù
avaiñëavo gurur na syäd
vaiñëavaù çva-paco guruù
“A scholarly brähmaëa,  expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to
become a spiritual master without being a Vaiñëava, or expert in the science of
Kåñëa consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become
a spiritual master if he is a Vaiñëava, or Kåñëa conscious.” ( Padma Puräëa )
The problems of material existence—birth, old age, disease and
death—cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic
development. In many parts of the wo rld there are states which are replete
with all facilities of life, which are full of wea lth and economically developed,
yet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace
in different ways, but they can achiev e real happiness only if they consult
Kåñëa, or the Bhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam —which constitute the
science of Kåñëa—through the bona fide  representative of Kåñëa, the man in
Kåñëa consciousness.
If economic development and material  comforts could drive away one’s
lamentations for family, social, nation al or international inebrieties, then
Arjuna would not have said that ev en an unrivaled kingdom on earth or
supremacy like that of the demigods in t he heavenly planets would be unableCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in Kåñëa
consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic
development or supremacy over the worl d can be finished at any moment by
the cataclysms of material nature. Even  elevation into a higher planetary
situation, as men are now seeking on th e moon planet, can also be finished at
one stroke. The Bhagavad-gétä  confirms this: kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti.
“When the results of pious a ctivities are finished, one falls down again from
the peak of happiness to the lowest stat u s  o f  l i f e . ”  M a n y  p o l i t i c i a n s  o f  t h e
world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more
causes for lamentation.
Therefore, if we want to curb lament ation for good, then we have to take
shelter of Kåñëa, as Arjuna is seeking to  do. So Arjuna asked Kåñëa to solve his
problem definitely, and that is the way of Kåñëa consciousness.

Saïjaya said: Having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told Kåñëa,
“Govinda, I shall not fight,” and fell silent.
PURPORT
Dhåtaräñöra must have been very glad  to understand that Arjuna was not
going to fight and was instead leav ing the battlefield for the begging
profession. But Saïjaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was
competent to kill his enemies ( parantap aù). Although Arjuna was, for the time
being, overwhelmed with false grief du e to family affection, he surrendered
unto Kåñëa, the supreme spiritual maste r, as a disciple. This indicated that he
would soon be free from the fa lse lamentation resulting from family affection
and would be enlightened with perfect kn owledge of self-realization, or Kåñëa
consciousness, and would then surely fight. Thus Dhåtaräñöra’s joy would be
frustrated, since Arjuna would be enligh tened by Kåñëa and would fight to the
end.

TRANSLATION
O descendant of Bharata, at that time Kåñëa, smiling, in the midst of both
the armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.
PURPORT
The talk was going on between intimate friends, namely the Håñékeça and
the Guòäkeça. As friends, both of them  were on the same level, but one of
them voluntarily became a student of the other. Kåñëa was smiling because a
friend had chosen to become a disc iple. As Lord of all, He is always in the
superior position as the master of ever yone, and yet the Lord agrees to be a
friend, a son, or a lover for a devotee who wants Him in such a role. But when
He was accepted as the maste r, He at once assumed the role  and talked with
the disciple like the master—with gravity, as it is required. It appears that the
talk between the master and the disc iple was openly exchanged in the
presence of both armies so that all were benefitted. So the talks of
Bhagavad-gétä  are n ot for any particular person, society, or community, but
they are for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: While speaking learned words,
you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament
neither for the living nor for the dead.
PURPORT
The Lord at once took the position  of the teacher and chastised the
student, calling him, indirectly, a fool. The Lord said, “You are talking like a
learned man, but you do not know th at one who is learned—one who knows
what is body and what is soul—does n ot lament for any stage of the body,
neither in the living nor in the dead  condition.” As explained in later
chapters, it will be clear that knowledg e means to know matter and spirit and
the controller of both. Arjuna argued that religious principles shoul d be given
more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that
knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than
religious formularies. And because he wa s lacking in that knowledge, he should
not have posed himself as a  very learned man. As he did not happen to be a
very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was
unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished
today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul. One who
knows this is actually learned, and fo r him there is no cause for lamentation,
regardless of the condition of the material body.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  12

In the Vedas,  in the Kaöha Upaniñad  as well as in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad,
it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the maintainer of
innumerable living entities, in terms of their different situations according to
individual work and reacti on of work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is
also, by His plenary portions, alive in the heart of every living entity. Only
saintly persons who can see, within and without, the same Supreme Lord can
actually attain to perfect and eternal peace.

The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world
who pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of
knowledge. The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna and all the kings
who are assembled on the battlefi eld are eternally individual beings and that
the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in
their conditioned and in their liberate d situations. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna , the Lord’s eternal
associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It is
not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will
not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past , and their
individuality will continue in the fu ture without interruption. Therefore,
there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.
The Mäyävädé theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by
the covering of mäyä,  or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and
lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord Kåñëa, the
supreme authority. Nor is the  theory that we only think of individuality in the
conditioned state supported herein. Kåñë a clearly says herein that in the
future also the individuality of the Lord  and others, as it is confirmed in the
Upaniñads,  will continue eternally. This statement of Kåñëa’s is authoritative
because Kåñëa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact,
then Kåñëa would not have stressed it  so much—even for the future. The
Mäyävädé may argue that the individuality spoken of by Kåñëa is not spiritual,
but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material,
then how can one distinguish Kåñëa’ s individuality? Kåñëa affirms His
individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He
has confirmed His individua lity in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has
been declared to be subordinate to Him. Kåñëa has maintained spiritual
individuality all along; if He is accept ed as an ordinary conditioned soul in
individual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-gétä  has no value  as authoritative
scripture. A common man with all the fo ur defects of human frailty is unable
to teach that which is worth hearing. The Gétä is above such literature. NoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-gétä.  When one accepts Kåñëa as
an ordinary m an, the Gétä loses all importance. The Mäyävädé argues that the
plurality mentioned in this verse is conven tional and that it refers to the body.
But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned.
After condemning the bodily concepti on of the living entities, how was it
possible for Kåñëa to place a conventi onal proposition on the body again?
Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus
confirmed by great äcäryas  like Çré Rämänuja and others. It is clearly
mentioned in many places in the Gétä that this spiritual individuality is
understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of
Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the
great literature. The nondevotee ’s approach to the teachings of the Gétä is
something like that of a bee licking on  a bottle of honey. One cannot have a
taste of honey unless one opens the bottl e. Similarly, the mysticism of the
Bhagavad-gétä  can be understood only by devotees, and no on e else can taste it,
as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter  of the book. Nor can the Gétä be touched
by persons who envy the very existenc e of the Lord. Therefore, the Mäyävädé
explanation of the Gétä is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth.
Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read  commentations made by the Mäyävädés
and warns that one who takes to such  an understanding of the Mäyävädé
philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the Gétä.  If
individuality refers to the empirical u niverse, then there is no need of teaching
by the Lord. The plurality of the individu al soul and of the Lord is an eternal
fact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas  as above mentioned.

TRANSLATION
As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to
youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober
person is not bewildered by such a change.
PURPORT
Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body
every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and
sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not
undergo any change. This individual  soul finally changes the body at death
and transmigrates to another body; and sinc e it is sure to have another body in
the next birth—either material or spiritual—there was no cause for
lamentation by Arjuna on account of  death, neither for Bhéñma nor for  Droëa,
for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their
changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such
changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to
one’s work in life. S o Bhéñma and Droëa, being noble souls, were surely going
to have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for
superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause
of lamentation.
Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual
soul, the Supersoul, and nature—both material and spiritual—is called a dhéra,
or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The Mäyävädé theory of oneness of th e spirit soul cannot be entertained, on
the ground that the spirit soul canno t be cut into pieces as a fragmental
portion. Such cutting into different in dividual souls would make the Supreme
cleavable or changeable, agai nst the principle of the Supreme Soul’s being
unchangeable. As confirmed in the Gétä,  the fragmental portions of the
Supreme exist eternally ( sanätana ) and are called kñara;  that is, they have a
tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are
eternally so, and even after liberati on the individual soul remains the
same—fragmental. But once liberated, he  lives an eternal life in bliss and
knowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be
applied to the Supers oul, who is present in each and every individual body and
is known as the Paramätmä. He is different from the individual living entity.
When the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and
the moon and the stars also. The stars ca n be compared to the living entities
and the sun or the moon to the Supr eme Lord. The individual fragmental
spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of
Godhead Çré Kåñëa. They are not on the same level, as it will be ap parent in
the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If  Arjuna is on the same level with
Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of
instructor and instructed becomes meanin gless. If both of them are deluded by
the illusory energy ( mäyä), then there is no need of one being the instructor
and the other the instructed. Such instru ction would be useless because, in the
clutches of mäyä,  no one can be an authorit ative instructor. Under the
circumstances, it is admitted that Lord Kåñëa is th e Supreme Lord, superior in
position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by mäyä.

Bharata, and one must learn t o tolerate them without being disturbed.
PURPORT
In the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent
appearances and disappearances of happiness and distress. According to Vedic
injunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the
month of Mägha (January-Februa ry). It is very cold at that time, but in spite of
that a man who abides by the religious pr inciples does not hesitate to take his
bath. Similarly, a woman does not hesi tate to cook in the kitchen in the
months of May and June, the hottest part of the summ er season. One has to
execute his duty in spite of climatic in conveniences. Similarly, to fight is the
religious principle of the kñatriyas,  and although one has to fight with some
friend or relative, one should not de viate from his prescribed duty. One ha s to
follow the prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to
rise up to the platform of knowledge,  because by knowledge and devotion only
can one liberate himself from the clutches of mäyä  (illusion).
The two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant. ToCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.address him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mother’s
side; and to address him as Bhärata signif ies his greatness from his father’s side.
From both sides he  is supposed to have a great heritage. A great heritage brings
responsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties; therefore, he cannot
avoid fighting.

PURPORT
Anyone who is steady in his dete rmination for the advanced stage of
spiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and
happiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation. In the varëäçramaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.institution, the fourth stage of li fe, namely the renounced order ( sannyäsa ), is
a painstaking situation. But one who is serious about making his life perfect
surely adopts the sannyäsa  order of life in spite of all difficulties. The
difficulties usually arise from having to sever family re lationships, to give up
the connection of wife and children. But if anyone is able to tolerate such
difficulties, surely his path to spiritua l realization is complete. Similarly, in
Arjuna’s discharge of duties as a kñatriya,  he is advised to persevere, ev en if it
is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons. Lord
Caitanya took sannyäsa  at the age of twenty-four, and His dependents, young
wife as well as old mother, had no one el se to look after them. Yet for a higher
cause He took sannyäsa  and was steady in the discharge of higher duties. That
is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage.

PURPORT
There is no endurance of the changi ng body. That the body is changing
every moment by the actions and reaction s of the different cells is admitted by
modern medical science; and thus growth  and old age are taking place in the
body. But the spirit soul exis ts permanently, remaining the same despite all
changes of the body and the mind. That  is the difference between matter and
spirit. By nature, the body is ever ch anging, and the soul is eternal. This
conclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist
and personalist. In the Viñëu Puräëa  (2.12.38 ) it is stated that Viñëu and His
abodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence ( jyotéàñi viñëur bhuvanäni
viñëuù ). The words existent  and nonexistent  refer only to spirit and ma tter.
That is the version of all seers of truth.
This is the beginning of the instructio n by the Lord to the living entities
who are bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance
involves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper
and the worshipable and the co nsequent understanding of the difference
between the part-and-parcel living en tities and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. One can understand the nature  of the Supreme by thorough study
of oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being und erstood
as the relationship between th e part and the whole. In the Vedänta-sütras,  as
well as in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  the Supreme has been accepted as the
origin of all emanations. Such emanat ions are experienced by superior and
inferior natural sequence s. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as
it will be revealed in the Seventh Ch apter. Although there is no difference
between the energy and the energetic,  the energetic is accepted as the
Supreme, and energy or nature is accepted as the sub ordinate. The living
entities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case
of the master and the servant, or th e teacher and the taught. Such clear
knowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance, and toCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.drive a way such ignorance the Lord teaches the Bhagavad-gétä  for the
enlightenment of all living entities for all time.

This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread
all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is
consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in
part or as a whole . This spreading of consciousness is limited within one’s own
body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore,
each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom
of the soul’s presence is perceived as i ndividual consciousness. This soul isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.described as one ten-thousandth part of  the upper portion of the hair point in
size. The Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (5.9) confirms this:
bälägra-çata-bhägasya
çatadhä kalpitasya ca
bhägo jévaù vijïeyaù
sa cänantyäya kalpate
“When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and
again each of such parts is further di vided into one hundred parts, each such
part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.” Similarly the same
version is stated:
keçägra-çata-bhägasya
çatäàçaù sädåçätmakaù
jévaù sükñma-svarüpo ’yaà
saìkhyätéto hi cit-kaëaù
 [Cc. Madya 19.140 ]
“There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as
one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.”
Therefore, the individual particle of sp irit soul is a spiritual atom smaller
than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small
spiritual spark is the basic principle of  the material body, and the influence of
such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active
principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the
spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the
presence of the soul. Any layman can  understand that the material body minus
consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the
body by any means of material administ ration. Therefore, consciousness is not
due to any amount of material combination, but to the spiri t soul. In the
Muëòaka Upaniñad  (3.1.9) the measurement of the atom ic spirit soul is further
explained:
eño ’ëur ätmä cetasä veditavyo
yasmin präëaù païcadhä saàviveçaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.präëaiç cittaà sarvam otaà prajänäà
yasmin viçuddhe vibhavaty eña ätmä
“The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence.
This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air ( präëa, apäna, vyäna,
samäna  and udäna ), is situated within the hear t, and spreads its influence all
over the body of the embodi ed living entities. When the soul is purified from
the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is
exhibited.”
The haöha-yoga  system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air
encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures—not for any
material profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of
the material atmosphere.
So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures,
and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only
the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading viñëu-tattva.
The influence of the atomic soul can be  spread all over a particular body.
According to the Muëòaka Upaniñad,  this atomic soul is situated in the heart
of every living entity, and because th e measurement of the atomic soul is
beyond the power of appreciati on of the material scientists, some of them
assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely
there in the heart along with the Supersou l, and thus all the energies of bodily
movement are emanating from this part of the body.  The corpuscles which
carry the oxygen from the lungs gather  energy from the soul. When the soul
passes away from this position, the activity of the blood, generating fusion,
ceases. Medical science accepts the impo rtance of the red corpuscles, but it
cann ot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science,
however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.
Such atomic particles of the spirit  whole are compared to the sunshine
molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly,
the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the
Supreme Lord, called by the name prabhä,  or superior energy. So whether one
follows Vedic knowledge or modern scie nce, one cannot deny the existence of
the spirit soul in the body, and the scienc e of the soul is explicitly described inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the Bhagavad-gétä  by the Personality of Godhead Himself.

The material body is perishable by na ture. It may perish immediately, or it
may do so after a hundred years. It is  a question of time only. There is no
chance of maintaining it indefinitely. Bu t the spirit soul is so minute that it
cannot even be seen by a n enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As
mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea
how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of
lamentation, because the living entity as he is cannot be k illed nor can the
material body be saved for any length of time or permanently protected. TheCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his
work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the
Vedänta-sütras  the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and
parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the
light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out
of this material  body, the body begins to decomp ose; therefore it is the spirit
soul which maintains this body. The body  itself is unimportant. Arjuna was
advised to fight and not sacrifice the cause of religion for material, bodily
considerations.

For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come
into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is
unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is
slain.
PURPORT
Qualitatively, the small atomic fragment al part of the Supreme Spirit is one
with the Supreme. He undergoes no ch anges like the body. Sometimes the soul
is called the steady, or küöa-stha.  The body is subject to six kinds of
transformations. It takes its b irth from the womb of the mother’s body, remains
for some time, grows, produces some e ffects, gradually dwindles, and at last
vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes.
The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a mate rial body, the body takes
its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die.
Anything which has birth also has deat h. And because the soul has no birth,
he therefore has no past, present or fu ture. He is eternal, ever-existing, and
primeval—that is, there is no trace in hi story of his coming into being. Under
the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The
soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man,
therefore, feels h imself to be in the same spirit  as in his childhood or youth.
The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate
like a tree, nor anything material. Th e soul has no by-product either. The
by-products of the body, namely children,  are also different individual souls;
and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body
develops because of the soul’s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor
change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.
In the Kaöha Upaniñad  (1.2.18 ) we also find a similar passage, which reads:
na jäyate mriyate vä vipaçcin
näyaà kutaçcin na babhüva kaçcitCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.ajo nityaù çäçvato ’yaà puräëo
na hanyate hanyamäne çarére
 [Bg. 2.20]
The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-gétä,
but here in this verse there is one special word, vipaçcit,  which means learned
or with knowledge.
The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore,
consciousness is the symptom of the soul . Even if one does not find the soul
within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of
the soul simply by th e presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the
sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the
sun is always there, and we are convince d that it is therefore daytime. As soon
as there is a little light in the sky e arly in the morning, we can understand that
the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all
bodies—whether man or animal—we can un derstand the presence of the soul.
This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the c onsciousness of
the Supreme because the supreme cons ciousness is all-knowledge—past,
present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be
forgetful. When he is forgetful of hi s real nature, he obtains education and
enlightenment from  the superior lessons of Kåñë a. But Kåñëa is not like the
forgetful soul. If so, Kåñëa’s teachings of Bhagavad-gétä  would be useless.
There are two kinds of souls—name ly the minute particle soul ( aëu-ätmä )
and the Supersoul ( vibhu-ätmä ). This is also confirmed in the Kaöha Upaniñad
(1.2.20 ) in this way:
aëor aëéyän mahato mahéyän
ätmäsya jantor nihito guhäyäm
tam akratuù paçyati véta-çoko
dhätuù prasädän mahimänam ätmanaù
“Both the Supersoul [Paramätmä] and the atomic soul [ jévätmä ] are situated
on the same tree of the body within th e same heart of the living being, and
only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations
can, by the grace of the S upreme, understand the glories of the soul.” Kåñëa isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following
chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore
he requires to be enlightened by Kåñëa, or by His bona fide representative (the
spiritual master).

PURPORT
Everything has its proper utility, and a man who is situated in complete
knowledge knows how and where to a pply a thing for its proper utility.
Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with the
person in knowledge. Although  the justice of the peace awards capital
punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peaceCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.cannot be blamed, because he orders vi olence to another person according to
the codes of justice. In Manu-saàhitä,  the lawbook for mankind, it is  supported
that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will
not have to suffer for the great sin he  has committed. Therefore, the king’s
punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when
Kåñëa orders figh ting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme
justice, and thus Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such
violence, committed in the act of fighting  for Kåñëa, is not violence at all
because, at any rate, the man, or rather the  soul, cannot be killed; so for the
administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation
is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be
executed by Arjuna at the inst ruction of Kåñëa is with full  knowledge, so there
is no possibility of sinful reaction.

As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly
accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.
PURPORT
Change of body by the atomic individual  soul is an accepted fact. Even the
modern scientists who do not believe in  the existence of the soul, but at the
same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept
continuous changes of body  which appear from childhood to boyhood and
from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the
change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in a
previous verse ( 2.13).
Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible
by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supe rsoul fulfills the desire of the atomic
soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas,  like the Muëòaka
Upaniñad,  as well as t he Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad,  compare the soul and the
Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the
individual atomic soul) is eating th e fruit of the tree, and the other bird
(Kåñëa) is simply watching His friend. Of these t wo birds—although they are
the same in quality—one is captivated by  the fruits of the material tree, while
the other is simply witnessing the ac tivities of His friend. Kåñëa is the
witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eati ng bird. Although they are friends, one
is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this
relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one’s changing his position from
one tree to another, or from one body to another. The jéva soul is struggling
very hard on the tree  of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept
the other bird as the supreme spiritual master—as Arjuna agreed to do by
voluntary surrender unto Kåñëa fo r instruction—the subordinate bird
immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Muëòaka Upaniñad
(3.1.2) and Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (4.7) confirm this:Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.samäne våkñe puruño nimagno
’néçayä çocati muhyamänaù
juñöaà yadä paçyaty anyam éçam
asya mahimänam iti véta-çokaù
“Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully
engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree.
But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and
knows His glories—at once  the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.”
Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, Kåñëa, and is
understanding the Bhagavad-gétä  from Him. And thus, hearing from Kåñëa, he
can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.
Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord  not to lament for the bodily change
of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their
bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all
reactions from various bodi ly activities. One who lays down his life on the
sacrificial altar, or in the proper battl efield, is at once cleansed of bodily
reactions and promoted to a higher stat us of life. So there was no cause for
Arjuna’s lamentation.

The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor

PURPORT
All kinds of weapons—swords, flame weapons, rain weapons, tornado
weapons, etc.—are unable to kill the sp irit soul. It appears that there were
many kinds of weapons made of earth, wa ter, air, ether, etc., in addition to the
modern weapons of fire. Even the  nuclear weapons of the modern age are
classified as fire weapons, but formerly  there were other weapons made of all
different types of material elements. Firearms were counteracted by water
weapons, which are now unknown to modern science. Nor do modern
scientists have knowledge of tornado weap ons. Nonetheless, the soul can never
be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of
scientific devices.
The Mäyävädé cannot explain how the in dividual soul came into existence
simply by ignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy. Nor
was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Supreme Soul;
rather, the individual soul s are eternally separated parts of the Supreme Soul.
Because they are atomic individual souls eternally ( sanätana ), they are prone
to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the
association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sp arks of a fire, although one in
quality with the fire, are prone to be ex tinguished when out of the fire. In the
Varäha Puräëa,  the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels
of the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the Bhagava d-gétä  also. So,
even after being liberated from illusion, the living entity remains a separate
identity, as is evident from the teac hings of the Lord to Arjuna. Arjuna
became liberated by the knowledge received from Kåñëa, but he never became
one with Kåñ ëa.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  24

PURPORT
All these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the
individual soul is eternally the atomic  particle of the spirit whole, and he
remains the same atom eternally, without change. The theory of monism is
very difficult to apply in this case , because the individual soul is never
expected to become one homogeneously. After liberation from material
contamination, the atomic soul may prefer  to remain as a spiritual spark in the
effulgent rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the intell igent soulsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the Personality of Godhead.
The word sarva-gata  (“all-pervading”) is significant because there is no
doubt that living entities are all over God’s creation. They live on the land, in
the water, in the air, within the earth and even within fire. The belief that
they are sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that
the soul cannot be burned by fire. Theref ore, there is no doubt that there are
living entities also in the sun planet with  suitable bodies to live there. If the
sun globe is uninhabited, then t he word sarva-gata —“living
everywhere”—becomes meaningless.

other source of understanding the existenc e of the soul, although it is a fact by
perception. There are many things we have to accept solely o n grounds of
superior authority. No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon
the authority of his mother. There is no  source of understanding the identity
of the father except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no
source of und erstanding the soul except by studying the Vedas.  In other words,
the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is
consciousness and conscious—that also is the statement of the Vedas,  and we
have to accept that. Unlike the bodily chan ges, there is no change in the soul.
As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the
infinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul  is infinite, and the atomic soul is
infinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, c an never
become equal to the infinite soul, or  the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
This concept is repeated in the Vedas  i n  d i f f e r e n t  w a y s  j u s t  t o  c o n f i r m  t h e
stability of the conception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in
order that we un derstand the matter thoroughly, without error.

TRANSLATION
If, however, you think that the soul [or the symptoms of life] is always born
and dies forever, you still have no  reason to lament, O mighty-armed.
PURPORT
There is always a class of philosophers , almost akin to the Buddhists, who do
not believe in the separate existence of  the soul beyond the body. When Lord
Kåñëa spoke the Bhagavad-gétä,  it appears that such philosophers existed, and
they were known as the lokäyatikas  and vaibhäñikas.  Such philosophers
maintain that life symptoms take pl ace at a certain mature condition of
material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist
philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a
combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms
develop by interaction of the physical  and chemical elements. The science of
anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo
religions—now becoming fashionable in Am erica—are also adhering to this
philosophy, as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.
Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul—as in the
vaibhäñika  philosophy—there would still have  been no cause for lamentation.
No one laments the loss of a certain bu lk of chemicals and stops discharging
his prescribed duty. On the other  hand, in modern science and scientific
warfare, so many tons of chemicals ar e wasted for achieving victory over the
enemy. According to the vaibhäñika  philosophy, the so-called soul or ätmä
vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any cas e, whetherCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that  there is an atomic soul or he did
not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According
to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter
every mo ment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment,
there is no need to grieve for such inci dents. If there were no rebirth for the
soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid  of being affected by sinful reactions
due to his killing his grandfather an d teacher. But at the same time, Kåñëa
sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mahä-bähu,  mighty-armed, because He, at
least, did not accept the theory of the vaibhäñikas,  which leaves aside the Vedic
wisdom. As a kñatriya,  Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved
him to continue to follow its principles.

PURPORT
One has to take birth according to one’s activities of life. And after
finishing one term of activities, one ha s to die to take birth for the next. In
this way one is going through one cy cle of birth and death after another
without liberation. This cycle o f birth and death does not, however, support
unnecessary murder, slaughter and war. But at the same time, violence and war
are inevitable factors in human society for keeping law and order.
The Battle of Kurukñetra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable
event, and to fight for the right cause is the duty of a kñatriya.  Why should he
be afraid of or aggrieved at the death of his relatives since he was discharging
his proper duty? He  did not deserve to break the law, thereby becoming
subjected to the reactions of sinful acts , of which he was so afraid. By avoiding
the discharge of his proper duty, he woul d not be able to stop the death of his
relatives, and he would be degraded due to  his selection of the wrong path of
action.

TRANSLATION
All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their
interim state, and unmanifest again when annihilated. So what need is there for
lamentation?
PURPORT
Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the
existence of the soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul,
there is no cause for lamentation in eith er case. Nonbelievers in the existence
of the soul are calle d atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for
argument’s sake, we accept this atheis tic theory, there is still no cause for
lamentation. Apart from the separate  existence of the soul, the material
elements remain unmanifested before creation. F rom this subtle state of
nonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated;
from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth
becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take
place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it
is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as
atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in
course of time things a re manifested and unmanifested—that is the difference.
Then what cause is there for lamentatio n either in the stage of manifestation
or in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage,
things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain
unmanifested, and only in the middle ar e they manifested, and this does not
make any real material difference.
And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä  that
these material bodies are perishable in due course of time ( antavanta ime
dehäù ) but that the soul is eternal ( nityasyoktäù çarériëaù ) ,  t h e n  w e  m u s t
remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the
changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation toCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the eternal soul. It is something like  a dream. In a dream we may think of
flying in the sky, or sitting on  a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can
see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom
encourages self-realization on the basi s of the nonexistence of the material
body. Therefore, in either case, whethe r one believes in the existence of the
soul or one does not believe in the existe nce of the soul, there is no cause for
lamentation for loss of the body.

PURPORT
Since Gétopaniñad  is largely based on the principles of the Upaniñads,  it is
not surprising to also find this passage in the Kaöha Upaniñad  (1.2.7):
çravaëayäpi bahubhir yo na labhyaù
çåëvanto ’pi bahavo yaà na vidyuù
äçcaryo vaktä kuçalo ’sya labdhä
äçcaryo ’sya jïätä kuçalänuçiñöaù
The fact that the atomic soul is within  the body of a gigantic animal, in the
body of a gigantic banyan tree, and al so in the microbic germs, millions and
billions of which occupy only an inch of  space, is certainly very amazing. Men
with a poor fund of kn owledge and men who are not austere cannot
understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it
is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even
to Brahmä, the first living being in the universe. Owi ng to a gross material
conception of things, most men in th is age cannot imagine how such a small
particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper
as wonderful either by constitution or  by description. Illusioned by the
materi al energy, people are so engrossed in subject matters for sense
gratification that they have very littl e time to understand the question of
self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this
self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for
existence. Perhaps they have no idea th at one must think of the soul, and thus
make a solution to the material miseries.
Some people who are inclined to he ar about the soul may be attending
lectures, in good association, but some times, owing to ignorance, they are
misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without
distinction of magnitude. It is very  difficult to find a man who perfectly
understands the position of the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective
functions and relationships and all othe r major and minor details. And it isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived ful l benefit from
knowledge of the soul, and who is able to  describe the position of the soul in
different aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the
subject matter of the soul, then one’s life is successful.
The easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is
to accept the statements of the Bhagavad-gétä  spoken by the greatest authority,
Lord Kåñëa, without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a
great deal of penance  and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones,
before one is able to accept Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Kåñëa can, however, be known as such  by the causeless mercy of the pure
devotee and by no other way.

The Lord now concludes the chapter of  instruction on the immutable spirit
soul. In describing the immortal soul in various ways, Lord Kåñëa establishes
that the soul is immortal and the body is temporary. Therefore Arjuna as a
kñatriya  should not abandon h is duty out of fear that his grandfather and
teacher—Bhéñma and Droëa—will die in the battle. On the authority of Çré
Kåñëa, one has to believe that there is a soul different from the material body,
not that there is no such thing as soul, or that living s ymptoms develop at a
certain stage of material maturity resu lting from the interaction of chemicals.
Though the soul is immortal, violence is  not encouraged, but at the time of war
it is not discouraged when there is ac tual need for it. That need must be
justified in terms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously.

Considering your specific duty as a kñatriya, you should know that there is
no better engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and so there
is no need for hesitation.
PURPORT
Out of the four orders of social ad ministration, the second order, for the
matter of good administration, is called kñatriya.  Kñat  means hurt. One who
gives protection from harm is called kñatriya  (träyate —to give protection). The
kñatriyas  are trained for  killing in the forest. A kñatriya  would go into the
forest and challenge a tiger face to face  and fight with the tiger with his sword.
When the tiger was killed, it would be  offered the royal order of cremation.
This system has been followed even up to th e present day by the kñatriya  kings
of Jaipur state. The kñatriyas  are specially trained for challenging and killing
because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, kñatriyas
are never meant for accepting directly the order of sannyä sa, or renunciation.
Nonviolence in politics may be a dipl omacy, but it is never a factor or
principle. In the religious law books it is stated:
ähaveñu mitho ’nyonyaà
jighäàsanto mahé-kñitaù
yuddhamänäù paraà çaktyä
svargaà yänty aparäì-mukhäù
yajïeñu paçavo brahman
hanyante satataà dvijaiù
saàskåtäù kila mantraiç ca
te ’pi svargam aväpnuvan
“In the battlefield, a king or kñatriya,  while fighting another king envious of
him, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the brähmaëas
also attain the heavenly planets by sacr ificing animals in the sacrificial fire.”Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Therefore, killi ng on the battlefield on religious principles and killing animals
in the sacrificial fire are not at all cons idered to be acts of violence, because
everyone is benefited by the religi ous principles involved. The animal
sacrificed gets a human life immediat ely without undergoing the gradual
evolutionary process from on e form to another, and the kñatriyas  killed on the
battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the brähmaëas  who attain
them by offering sacrifice.
There are two kinds of sva-dharmas,  specific duties. As long as one is not
liberated, one has to perform the duties of his particular body in accordance
with religious principles in order to ac hieve liberation. When one is liberated,
one’s sva-dharma —speci fic duty—becomes spiritual and is not in the material
bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the
brähmaëas  and kñatriyas  respectively, and such duties are unavoidable.
Sva-dharma  is ordained by the Lord, and this wil l be clarified in the Fourth
Chapter. On the bodily plane sva-dharma  is called varëäçrama-dharma,  or
man’s steppingstone for spiritual unde rstanding. Human civilization begins
from the stage of varëäçrama-dharma,  or specific duties in terms of the specific
modes of nature of the body obtained. Discharging one’s specific duty in any
field of action in accordance with the orders of higher authorities serves to
elevate one to a higher status of life.

As supreme teacher of the world, Lord Kåñëa condemns the attitude of
Arjuna, who said, “I do not find any good in this fighting. It will cause
perpetual habitation in hell.” Such statements by Arjuna were due to
ignorance only. He wanted to become nonviole nt in the discharge of his
specific duty. For a kñatriya  to be on the battlefield and to become nonviolent
is the philosophy of fools. In the Paräçara-småti,  or religious codes made by
Paräçara, the great sage and father of Vyäsadeva, it is stated:
kñatriyo hi prajä rakñan
çastra-päëiù pradaëòayan
nirjitya para-sainyädi
kñitià dharmeëa pälayet
“The kñatriya’s  duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties,
and for that reason he has to apply viol ence in suitable cases for law and order.
Therefore he has to conquer the soldie rs of inimical kings, and thus, with
religious principle s, he should rule over the world.”
Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he
should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die
in the battle, he would be elevated to  the heavenly planets, whose doors were
wide open to him. Fight ing would be for his benefit in either case.

PURPORT
Lord Kåñëa now directly says that Arjuna should fight for the sake of
fighting because He desires the battle. There is no consideration of happiness
or distress, profit or gain, victory or  defeat in the activities of Kåñëa
consciousness. That everything sh ould be performed for the sake of Kåñëa is
transcendental consciousness; so there is  no reaction to material activities. He
who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is
subject to the reaction, good or bad. But he who has completely surrendered
himself in the activities of Kåñëa consci ousness is no longer obliged to anyone,
nor is he a debtor to anyone, as one is in  the ordinary course of activities. It is
said:
devarñi-bhütäpta-nåëäà pitèëäà

nor forefathers.” ( Bhäg.  11.5.41) That is the indirect hint given by Kåñëa to
Arjuna in this verse, and the matter will be more clearly explained in the
following verses.

Thus far I have described this knowle dge to you through analytical study.
Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without fruitive results. O son of

PURPORT
According to the Nirukti,  or the Vedic dictionary, saìkhyä  means that
which describes things in detail, and säìkhya  refers to that philosophy whichCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses.
Arjuna’s proposal not to fi ght was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his
prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting , because he thought that by not killing
his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom
after conquering his cousins and brothers, the s ons of Dhåtaräñöra. In both
ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from
conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on
the basis of personal sense gratificatio n, even at a sacrifice of wisdom a nd duty.
Kåñëa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his
grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all
individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they
were individ uals in the past, they are individu als in the present, and they will
continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual
souls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but
actually we keep our individual ity even after liberation from the bondage of
material dress. An analytical study of  the soul and the body has been very
graphically explained by Lord Kåñëa. And this descriptive knowledge of the
soul and the body from different angles of vision has been d escribed here as
Säìkhya, in terms of the Nirukti  dictionary. This Säìkhya has nothing to do
with Säìkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter
Kapila’s Säìkhya, the Säìkhya philosophy was expounded in the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  by the true  Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kåñëa,
who explained it to His mother, Devahüti . It is clearly explained by Him that
the puruña,  or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over
the prakåti.  This is accepted in the Vedas  and in the Gétä.  The description in
the Vedas  indicates that the Lord glanced over the prakåti,  or nature, and
impregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working
in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of materia l
energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the
last point of liberation when the living  entity wants to become one with the
Lord. This is the last snare of mäyä,  or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is
only after many, ma ny births of such sense gratif icatory activities that a great
soul surrenders unto Väsudeva, Lord Kåñë a, thereby fulfilling the search afterCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the ultimate truth.
Arjuna has already accepted Kåñëa as his spiritual master by surrendering
himself unto Him: çiñyas te ’haà çädhi mäà tväà prapannam . Consequently,
Kåñëa will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga,  or
karma-yoga,  or in other words, the pract ice of devotional service only for the
sense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga  is clearly explained in
Chapter Ten , verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is
sitting as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart. But such communion does not t ake
place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional
or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in Kåñëa
consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga  by the special grace of the
Lord. The Lord says , therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in
devotional service out of transcende ntal love does He award the pure
knowledge of devotion in love. In th at way the devotee can reach Him easily
in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.
Thus the buddhi-yoga  mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of
the Lord, and the word Säìkhya mentione d herein has nothing to do with the
atheistic säìkhya-yoga  enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not,
therefore, misunderstand that the  säìkhya-yoga  mentioned herein has any
connection with the atheistic Säìkhya.  Nor did that philosophy have any
influence during that time; nor would Lo rd Kåñëa care to mention such godless
philosophical speculations. Real Säìkhya philosophy is described by  Lord
Kapila in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  but even that Säìkhya has nothing to do
with the current topics. Here, Säìkhya means analytical description of the
body and the soul. Lord Kåñëa made an analytical description of the soul just
to bring Arjuna to the p oint of buddhi-yoga,  or bhakti-yoga.  Therefore, Lord
Kåñëa’s Säìkhya and Lord Kapila’s Säìkhya, as described in the Bhägavatam,
are one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga.  Lord Kåñëa Said, therefore,
that only the less intelligent class of men make a d istinction between
säìkhya-yoga  and bhakti-yoga  (säìkhya-yogau påthag bäläù pravadanti na
paëòitäù ).
Of course, atheistic säìkhya-yoga  has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga,  yet
the unintelligent claim that the atheistic säìkhya-yoga  is referred to in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Bhagavad-gétä.
One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga  means to work in Kåñëa
consciousness, in the full bliss and kno wledge of devotional service. One who
works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may
be, is working under the prin ciples of buddhi-yoga  and finds himself always in
transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all
transcendental understanding automati cally, by the grace of the Lord, and
thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his mak ing extraneous
endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in
Kåñëa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of
sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material
happiness. Buddh i-yoga  is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that
we perform.

PURPORT
Activity in Kåñëa consciousness, or ac ting for the benefit of Kåñëa without
expectation of sense gratification, is  the highest transcendental quality of
work. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can
that small beginning be lost  at any stage. Any work begun on the material
plane has to be completed, otherwise th e whole attempt becomes a failure. But
any work begun in Kåñëa consciousness has a permanent effect, even though
not finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his
work in Kåñëa consciousness is inco mplete. One percent done in Kåñëa
consciousness bears permanent results, so  that the next beginning is from the
point of two percent, whereas in mater ial activity without a hundred percent
success th ere is no profit. Ajämila performed his duty in some percentage of
Kåñëa consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred
percent, by the grace of the Lord. Ther e is a nice verse in this connection in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.5.17 ):
tyaktvä sva-dharmaà caraëämbujaà harer
bhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi
yatra kva väbhadram abhüd amuñya kià

“If someone gives up his occupational duties and works in Kåñëa
consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work,
what loss is there on his part? And wh at can one gain if one performs his
material activities perfectly?” Or, as the Ch ristians say, “What profiteth a man
if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul?”
Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in Kåñëa
consciousness carries a person again to Kåñëa consciousness, even after the loss
of the body. At least one is sure to have  a chance in the next life of being born
again as a human b eing, either in the family of a great cultured brähmaëa  or in
a rich aristocratic family that will gi ve one a further chance for elevation.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.That is the unique quality of work done in Kåñëa consciousness.

Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O

PURPORT
A strong faith that by Kåñëa consci ousness one will be elevated to the
highest perfection of life is called vyavasäyätmikä  intelligence. The
Caitanya-caritämåta  (Madhya  22.62 ) states:
’çraddhä’-çabde——viçväsa kahe sudåòha niçcaya
kåñëe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kåta hayaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Faith means unflinching trust in some thing sublime. When one is engaged
in the duties of Kåñëa consciousness, he  need not act in relationship to the
material world with obligations to fami ly traditions, humanity, or nationality.
Fruitive activities are the  engagements of one’s reactions from past good or bad
deeds. When one is awake in Kåñëa consciousness, he need no longer endeavor
for good results in his activities. When one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness,
all activities are on the absolute plane, for  they are no longer subject to
dualities like good and bad. The highes t perfection of Kåñëa consciousness is
renunciation of the material conception  of life. This state is automatically
achieved by progressive Kåñëa consciousness.
The resolute purpose of a person in Kåñëa consciousness is based on
knowledge. Väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä su-durlabhaù : a person in Kåñëa
consciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that Väsudeva, or
Kåñëa, is the root of all manifested ca uses. As by watering the root of a tree
one automatically distributes water to th e leaves and branches, so by acting in
Kåñëa consciousness one can render th e highest service to everyone—namely
self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If Kåñëa is sat isfied by one’s
actions, then everyone will be satisfied.
Service in Kåñëa consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able
guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Kåñëa, who
knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in Kåñëa
consciousness. As such, to be wel l versed in Kåñëa consciousness one has to act
firmly and obey the representative of Kåñëa, and one should accept the
instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one’s mission in life. Çréla
Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura instructs us, in his famous pr ayers for the
spiritual master, as follows:
yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädo
yasyäprasädän na gatiù kuto ’pi
dhyäyan stuvaàs tasya yaças tri-sandhyaà
vande guroù çré-caraëäravindam  
“By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead becomes satisfied. And by not sa tisfying the spiritual master, there isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.no chance of being promoted to the pl ane of Kåñëa consciousness. I should,
therefore, meditate and pray for  his mercy three times a day, and offer my
respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.”
The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul
beyond the conception of the body—n ot theoretically but practically, when
there is no longer a chance for sens e gratification manifested in fruitive
activities. One who is not firmly fixe d in mind is diverted by various types of
fruitive acts.

TRANSLATION
Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the
Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly
planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense
gratification and opulent lif e, they say that there is nothing more than this.
PURPORT
People in general are not very intelli gent, and due to their ignorance they
are most attached to the fruitive  activities recommended in the karma-käëòa
portions of the Vedas.  They do not want anything more than sense
gratificatory proposals for enjoying li fe in heaven, where wine and women are
available and material opulence is very common. In the Vedas  many sacrifices
are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the
jyotiñöoma  sacrifices. In fact, it is st ated that anyone desiring elev ation to
heavenly planets must perform these sa crifices, and men with a poor fund of
knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very
difficult for such inexperienced person s to be situated in the determined
action of Kåñëa consci ousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of
poisonous trees without knowing the result s of such attractions, unenlightened
men are similarly attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense
enjoyment thereof.
In the karma-käëòa  section of the Vedas  it is said, apäma somam amåtä
abhüma  and akñayyaà ha vai cäturmasya-yäjinaù sukåtaà bhavati.  In other
words, those who perform the four-month  penances become eligible to drink
the soma-rasa  beverages to become immort al and happy forever. Even on this
earth some are very eager to have soma-rasa  to become strong and fit to enjoy
sense gratifications. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material
bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies  ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Vedic sacrifices. They are generally se nsual, and they do not want anything
other than the heavenly pleasures of li fe. It is understood that there are
gardens called Nandana-känana in which there is good opportunity for
association with angelic, beauti ful women and having a profuse supply of
soma-rasa  wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are
those who are purely attached to such material, temporary happiness, as lords
of the material world.

All material activities involve action s and reactions in the three modes of
material nature. They are meant for fr uitive results, which cause bondage in
the material world. The Vedas  deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually
elevate the general pub lic from the field of sense gratification to a position on
the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Kåñëa, is
advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedänta  philosophy
where, in the beginning, there is brahma-ji jïäsä,  or questions on the supreme
transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are
struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the
material world, gave the Vedic wisdom  advising how to live and get rid of the
material entanglement. When the activiti es for sense gratification, namely the
karma-käëòa  chapter, are finished, then the ch ance for spiritual realization is
offered in the form of the Upaniñads,  which are part of different Vedas,  as the
Bhagavad-g étä is a part of the fifth Veda,  namely the Mahäbhärata.  The
Upaniñads  mark the beginning of transcendental life.
As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the
material modes. One has to learn tolera nce in the face of dualities such as
happiness and distress, or cold and warm th, and by tolerating such dualities
become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental
position is achieved in full Kåñëa consciousness when one is fully dependent
on the good will of Kåñëa.

All purposes served by a small well can at  once be served by a great reservoir

knows the purpose behind them.
PURPORT
The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-käëòa  division of the
Vedic literature are meant to encourage gradual development of
self-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the
Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä  (15.15): the purpose of studying the
Vedas  i s  t o  k n o w  L o r d  K å ñ ë a ,  t h e  p r imeval cause of everything. So,
self-realization means understanding Kå ñëa and one’s eternal relationship with
Him. The relationship of the living en tities with Kåñëa is also mentioned in
the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä  (15.7). The living entities are parts and
parcels of Kåñëa; therefore, revival of Kåñëa consciousness by the individual
living entity is the highest perfection al stage of Vedic knowledge. This is
confirmed in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.33.7 ) as follows:
aho bata çva-paco ’to garéyän
yaj-jihvägre vartate näma tubhyam
tepus tapas te juhuvuù sasnur äryä
brahmänücur näma gåëanti ye te
“O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.low family like that of a caëòäla  [dog-eater], is situated on the highest platform
of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances
and sacrifices according  to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures
many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage.
Such a person is considered to be the best of the Äryan family.
So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas,
without being attached to the rituals on ly, and must not desire to be elevated
to the heavenly kingdoms for a better qual ity of sense gratification. It is not
possible for the common  man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations
of the Vedic rituals, nor is it  possible to study all of the Vedänta  and the
Upaniñads  thoroughly. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources
to execute the purposes of the Vedas.  This is  hardly possible in this age. The
best purpose of Vedic culture is served , however, by chanting the holy name of
the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls.
When Lord Caitanya was asked by  a great Vedic scholar, Prakäçänan da
Sarasvaté, why He, the Lord, was chanting  t h e  h o l y  n a m e  o f  t h e  L o r d l i k e  a
sentimentalist instead of studying Vedänta  philosophy, the Lord replied that
His spiritual master had found Him to be a great fool and thus asked Him to
chant the holy name of Lo rd Kåñëa. He did so, and became ecstatic like a
madman. In this Age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not
adequately educated to understand Vedänta  philosophy; the best purpose of
Vedänta  philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy  name of the
Lord. Vedänta  is the last word in Vedic wisd om, and the author and knower of
the Vedänta  philosophy is Lord Kåñëa; and the highest Vedäntist is the great
soul who takes pleasure in chanting th e  h o l y  n a m e  o f  t h e  L o r d .  T h a t  i s  t h e
ultimate purpo se of all Vedic mysticism.

TRANSLATION
You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to
the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your
activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.
PURPORT
There are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and
inaction. Prescribed duties are activiti es enjoined in terms of one’s acquired
modes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction
of authority, and inact ion means not performing one’s prescribed duties. The
Lord advised that Arjuna not be inacti ve, but that he perform his prescribed
duty without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of
his work is also the cause of the action. Thu s he is the enjoyer or sufferer of
the result of such actions.
As far as prescribed duties are conc erned, they can be fitted into three
subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities.
Routine work performed as an obli gation in terms of the scriptural
injunctions, without desire for results, i s action in the mode of goodness. Work
with results becomes the cause of bo ndage; therefore such work is not
auspicious. Everyone has his proprietary right in regard to prescribed duties,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory
duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.
Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty
without attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another
side of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation.
Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful.
Therefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of
salvation for Arjuna.

Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to

PURPORT
Kåñëa tells Arjuna that he should act in yoga.  And what is that yoga? YogaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.means to concentrate the mind upon  the Supreme by controlling the
ever-disturbing senses. And who is th e Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord.
And because He Himself is telling Arjuna t o fight, Arjuna has nothing to do
with the results of the fight. Gain or  victory are Kåñëa’s concern; Arjuna is
simply advised to act according to th e dictation of Kåñëa. The following of
Kåñëa’s dictation is real yoga,  and this is practiced in the process  called Kåñëa
consciousness. By Kåñëa consciousness only can one give up the sense of
proprietorship. One has to become the se rvant of Kåñëa, or the servant of the
servant of Kåñëa. That is the righ t way to discharge duty in Kåñëa
consciousness, which alon e can help one to act in yoga.
Arjuna is a kñatriya,  and as such he is participating in the
varëäçrama-dharma  institution. It is said in the Viñëu Puräëa  that in the
varëäçrama-dharma,  the whole aim is to satisfy Viñëu. No one should satisfy
himself, as is the rule in the material world , but one should satisfy Kåñëa. So
unless one satisfies Kåñëa, one cannot correctly observe the principles of
varëäçrama-dharma.  Indirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as Kåñëa told him.

TRANSLATION
O Dhanaïjaya, keep all abominable activities far distant by devotional
service, and in that consciousness surre nder unto the Lord. Those who want to
enjoy the fruits of their work are misers.
PURPORT
One who has actually come to understa nd one’s constitutional position as
an eternal servitor of the Lord gives up  all engagements save working in Kåñëa
consciousness. As already explained, buddhi-yoga  means transcendental loving
service to the Lord. Such d evotional service is the right course of action for
the living entity. Only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of their own work just to
be further entangled in material bondage. Except for work in Kåñëa
consciousness, all activities are abominable because t hey continually bind the
worker to the cycle of birth and death. One should therefore never desire to be
the cause of work. Everything should be  done in Kåñëa consciousness, for the
satisfaction of Kåñëa. Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of ric hes
which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor. One should spend all
energies working in Kåñëa consciousn ess, and that will make one’s life
successful. Like misers, unfortunate persons do not employ their human energy
in the service of the Lord.

Since time immemorial each living entity has accumulated the various
reactions of his good and bad work. As su ch, he is continuously ignorant of his
real constitutional position. One’ s ignorance can be removed by the
instruction of the Bhagavad-gétä,  which  teaches one to surrender unto Lord Çré
Kåñëa in all respects and become libe rated from the chained victimization of
action and reaction, birth after birth. Arjuna is therefore advised to act in
Kåñëa consciousness, the purifying process of resultant actio n.

TRANSLATION
By thus engaging in devotional servic e to the Lord, great sages or devotees
free themselves from the results of work in the material world. In this way they
become free from the cycle of birth and death and attain the state beyond all
miseries [by going ba ck to Godhead].
PURPORT
The liberated living entities belong to that place where there are no
material miseries. The Bhägavatam  (10.14.58 ) says:
samäñritä ye pada-pallava-plavaà
mahat-padaà puëya-yaço muräreù
bhavämbudhir vatsa-padaà paraà padaà
padaà padaà yad vipadäà na teñäm
“For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the
shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mukunda, or the giver of
mukti,  the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf’s
footprint. paraà padam , or the place where there are no material miseries, or
Vaikuëöha, is his goal, not the place wh ere there is danger in every step of
life.”
Owing to ignorance, one does not kn ow that this material world is a
miserable place where there are dangers at every step. Out of ignorance only,
less intelligent persons try to adjust to  the situation by fruitive activities,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.thinking that the resultant ac tions will make them happy. They do not know
that no kind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life
without miseries. The miseries of life, na mely birth, death, old age and diseases,
are present everywhere within the material world. But o ne who understands
his real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus
knows the position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the
transcendental loving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualified
to enter  into the Vaikuëöha planets, where there is neither material, miserable
life nor the influence of time and death.  To know one’s constitutional position
means to know also the sublime positi on of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks
that the living entity’s pos ition and the Lord’s position are on the same level is
to be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in
the devotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus paves
the way for the repetition of birth and death. But one who, understanding that
his position is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once
becomes eligible for Vaikuëöhaloka. Service for the cause of the Lord is called
karma-yoga  or buddhi-yoga,  or in plain words, devotional service  to the Lord.

TRANSLATION
When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you
shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard.
PURPORT
There are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the Lord
of those who became indifferent to the rituals of the Vedas  simply by
devotional service to the Lord. When a person factually understands Kåñëa
and his relationship with Kåñëa, he naturally becomes completely indifferent
to the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced brähmaëa.  Çré
Mädhavendra Puré, a great devotee and äcärya  in the line of the devotees, says:
sandhyä-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bhoù snäna tubhyaà namo
bho deväù pitaraç ca tarpaëa-vidhau nähaà kñamaù kñamyatäm
yatra kväpi niñadya yädava-kulottamasya kaàsa-dviñaù

“O my prayers three times a day, all glory to you. O bathing, I offer my
obeisances unto you. O demigods! O forefathers! Please excuse me for my
inability to offer you my respects. No w wherever I sit, I can remember the
great descendant of the Yadu dynasty  [Kåñëa], the enemy of Kaàsa, and
thereby I can free myself from all sinful bondage. I think this is sufficient for
me.”
The Vedic rites and rituals are imperati ve for neophytes: comprehending all
kinds of prayer three times a day, taking  a bath early in the morning, offering
respects to the forefathers, etc. But when one is fully in Kåñëa consciousness
and is engaged in His  transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent
to all these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection. If
one can reach the platform of understa nding by service to the Supreme Lord
Kåñëa, he has no longer to execute differen t types of penances and sacrifices asCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.recommended in revealed scriptures. And,  similarly, if one has not understood
that the purpose of the Vedas  is to reach Kåñëa and simply engages in the
rituals, etc., then he is uselessl y wasting time in such engagemen ts. Persons in
Kåñëa consciousness transcend the limit of çabda-brahma,  or the range of the
Vedas  and Upaniñads.

When your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the

PURPORT
To say that one is in samädhi  is to say that one has fully realized Kåñëa
consciousness; that is, one in full samädhi  has realized Brahman, ParamätmäCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.and Bhagavän. The highest perfection of self-realization is to understand that
one is eternally the servit or of Kåñëa and that one’s only business is to
discharge one’s duties in Kåñëa consciousness. A Kåñëa conscious person, or
unflinching devotee of the Lord, shou ld not be disturbed by the flowery
language of the Vedas  nor be engaged in fruitive activities f or promotion to the
heavenly kingdom. In Kåñëa consciousness, one comes directly into
communion with Kåñëa, and thus all di rections from Kåñëa may be understood
in that transcendental state. One is su re to achieve results by such activities
and attain conc lusive knowledge. One has only to carry out the orders of
Kåñëa or His representative, the spiritual master.

How does he sit, and how does he walk?
PURPORT
As there are symptoms for each and every man, in terms of his particular
situation, similarly one who is Kåñëa conscious has his particular
nature—talking, walking, thinking, f eeling, etc. As a rich man has his
symptoms by which he is known as a rich man, as a diseased man has his
symptoms by which he is known as diseased, or as a learned man has his
symptoms, so a man in transcendental  consciousness of Kåñëa has specific
symptoms in various dealings. One can know his specific symptoms from the
Bhagavad-gét ä. Most important is how the man in Kåñëa consciousness speaks;
for speech is the most important quality of  any man. It is said that a fool is
undiscovered as long as he does not speak, and certainly a well-dressed fool
cannot be identified unless he speak s, but as soon as he speaks, he reveals
himself at once. The immediate symptom of a Kåñëa conscious man is that he
speaks only of Kåñëa and of matters relating to Him. Other symptoms then
automatically follow, as stated below.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O Pärtha, when a man gives up
all varieties of desire for sense gratification, which arise from mental
concoction, and when his mind, thus purified, finds satisfaction in the self
alone, then he is said to be in pur e transcendental consciousness.
PURPORT
The Bhägavatam  affirms that any person who is fully in Kåñëa
consciousness, or devotional service of  the Lord, has all the good qualities of
the great sages, whereas a person who is  not so transcendentally situated has
no good qualifications, because he is  sure to be taking refuge in his own mental
concoctions. Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all
kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction. Artificially, such
sense desires cannot be stopped. But if one is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness,
then, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts.
Therefore, one has to engage hims elf in Kåñëa consciousness without
hesitation, for this devotional service will instantly help one onto the platform
of transcen dental consciousness. The highly  developed soul always remains
satisfied in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme
Lord. Such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting
from petty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position
of eternally serving the Supreme Lord.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  56

TRANSLATION
One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or
elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and
anger, is called a sage of steady mind.
PURPORT
The word muni  means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for
mental speculation without coming to a fa ctual conclusion. It is said that every
muni  has a different angle of vision, and unless a muni  differs from other
munis,  he cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term. Näsäv åñir
yasya mataà na bhinnam  (Mahäbhärata, Vana-parva  313.117 ). But a sthita-dhér
muni,  as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary muni.
The sthita-dhér muni  is always in Kåñëa consciousness, for  he has exhausted all
his business of creative speculation. He is calledCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.praçänta-niùçeña-mano-rathäntara  (Stotra-ratna  43), or one who has surpassed
the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord Çré
Kåñëa, or Väsudeva, is every thing ( väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä
su-durlabhaù ). He is called a muni  fixed in mind. Such a fully Kåñëa conscious
person is not at all disturbed by the on slaughts of the threefold miseries, for he
accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking  himself only worthy of
more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the
grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he
gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he
realizes that it is due only to the Lord’s grace that he is in such a comfortable
condition and able to render better serv ice to the Lord. And, for the service of
the Lord, he is always daring and acti ve and is not influenced by attachment
or aversion. Attach ment means accepting things for one’s own sense
gratification, and detachment is the ab sence of such sensual attachment. But
one fixed in Kåñëa consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment
because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Co nsequently he is not
at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. Success or no success, a
Kåñëa conscious person is always steady in his determination.

There is always some upheaval in the material world which may be good or
evil. One who is not agitated by such ma terial upheavals, who is unaffected by
good and evil, is to be understood to be fixed in Kåñëa consciousness. As long
as one is in the material  world there is always the possibility of good and evil
because this world is full of dualit y. But one who is fixed in Kåñëa
consciousness is not affected by good and evil, because he is simply concerned
with Kåñëa, who is all-good absolute. Such conscious ness in Kåñëa situates one
in a perfect transcendental position called, technically, samädhi.

TRANSLATION
One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise
draws its limbs within the shell, is firmly fixed in perfect consciousness.
PURPORT
The test of a yogé, devotee, or self-realized soul is that he is able to control
the senses according to his plan. Most people, however, are servants of the
senses and are thus directed by the dict ation of the senses. That is the answer
to the question as to how the yogé is situated. The senses are compared to
venomous serpents. They want to act ve ry loosely and without restriction. The
yogé, or the devotee, must be very strong  to control the serpents—like a snake
charmer. He never allows them to act indepe ndently. There are many
injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not’s, and some of
them are do’s. Unless one is able to follo w the do’s and the do-not’s, restricting
oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in  Kåñëa
consciousness. The best example, set here in, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at
any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for
particular purposes. Similarly, the sens es of the Kåñëa conscious persons are
u s e d  o n l y  f o r  s o m e  p articular purpose in the service of the Lord and are
withdrawn otherwise. Arjuna is being ta ught here to use his senses for the
service of the Lord, instead of for hi s own satisfaction. Keeping the senses
always in the service of the Lord is the example se t by the analogy of the
tortoise, who keeps the senses within.

TRANSLATION
The embodied soul may be restricted fr om sense enjoyment, though the taste
for sense objects remains. But, ceasin g such engagements by experiencing a
higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.
PURPORT
Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from
sense enjoyment. The process of restrict ion from sense enjoyment by rules and
regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of
eatables. The patient,  however, neither likes such restrictions nor loses his
taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like
añöäìga-yoga,  in the matter of yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära,
dhäraëä, dhyäna,  etc., is recommended for les s intelligent persons who have no
better knowledge. But one who has tast ed the beauty of the Supreme Lord
Kåñëa, in the course of his advancement in Kåñëa consciousness, no longer has
a taste for dead, material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for  the less
intelligent neophytes in the spiritual ad vancement of life, but such restrictions
are only good until one actually has a taste for Kåñëa consciousness. When one
is actually Kåñëa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  60

The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry

PURPORT
There are many learned sages, philosophers and transcendentalists who try
to conquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the greatest of
them sometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated
mind. Even Viçvämitra, a great  sage and perfect yogé, was misled by Menakä
into sex enjoyment, although the yogé was endeavoring for sense control with
severe types of penance and yoga practice. And, of course, there are so many
similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore,  it is very difficult to
control the mind and senses without being fully Kåñëa conscious. WithoutCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.engaging the mind in Kåñëa, one canno t cease such material engagements. A
practical example is given by Çré Yämunä cärya, a great saint and devotee, who
says:
yad-avadhi mama cetaù kåñëa-pädäravinde
nava-nava-rasa-dhämany udyataà rantum äsét
tad-avadhi bata näré-saìgame smaryamäne
bhavati mukha-vikäraù suñöhu niñöhévanaà ca
“Since my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord
Kåñëa, and I have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever
I think of sex life with a woman, my face at once turns from it , and I spit at the
thought.”
Kåñëa consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that
automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man
had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables.
Mahäräja Ambaréña also conquered a great  yogé, Durväsä Muni, simply because
his mind was engaged in Kåñëa consciousness ( sa vai manaù

PURPORT
That the highest conception of yoga perfection is Kåñëa consciousness is
clearly explained in this verse. And un less one is Kåñëa conscious it is not at
all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durväsä Muni
picked a quarrel with M ahäräja Ambaréña, and Durväsä Muni unnecessarily
became angry out of pride and therefor e could not check his senses. On the
other hand, the king, although not as powerful a yogé as the sage, but a devotee
of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage’s inju stices and thereby emerged
victorious. The king was able to control his senses because of the following
qualifications, as mentioned in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (9.4.18–20 ):
sa vai manaù kåñëa-pädäravindayor

“King Ambaréña fixed his mind on the lo tus feet of Lord Kåñëa, engaged his
words in describing the abode of the Lo rd, his hands in cleansing the temple ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes  of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the
form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in
smelling the flavor of the flowers offe red to the lotus feet of the Lord, his
tongue in tasting the tulasé  leaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the
holy place where His temple is situated , his head in offering obeisances unto
the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord... and all these
qualifications made him fit to become a mat-para  devotee of the Lord.”
The word mat-para  is most significant in this connection. How one can
become mat-para  is described in the life of Mahäräja Ambaréña. Çréla Baladeva
Vidyäbhüñaëa, a great scholar and äcärya  in the line of the mat-para,  remarks,
mad-bhakti-prabhävena sarvend riya-vijaya-pürvikä svätma-dåñöiù sulabheti
bhävaù.  “The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of
devotional service to Kåñëa.” Also, the ex ample of fire is sometimes given: “As
a blazing fire burns everything within a room, Lord Viñëu, situated in the
heart of the yogé, burns up all kinds of impurities.” The Yoga-sütra  also
prescribes meditation on Viñëu, and not meditation on the void. The so-called
yogés  who meditate on something which is  not on the Viñëu platform simply
waste their ti me in a vain search after some  phantasmagoria. We have to be
Kåñëa conscious—devoted to the Personal ity of Godhead. This is the aim of
the real yoga.

TRANSLATION
While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment
for them, and from such attachment lust  develops, and from lust anger arises.
PURPORT
One who is not Kåñëa conscious is su bjected to material desires while
contemplating the objects of the senses. The senses require real engagements,
and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord,
they will certainly seek engag ement in the service of materialism. In the
material world everyone, including Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä—to say
nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets—is subjected to the
influence of sense objects, and the on ly method to get out of this puzzle of
material existence is to become Kåñë a conscious. Lord Çiva was deep in
meditation, but when Pärvaté agitated hi m for sense pleasure, he agreed to the
proposal, and as a result Kärtikeya wa s born. When Haridäsa Öhäkura was a
young devotee of the Lord, he  was similarly allured by the incarnation of
Mäyä-devé, but Haridäsa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed
devotion to Lord Kåñëa. As illustrate d in the above-mentioned verse of Çré
Yämunäcärya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material se nse
enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of
the Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in Kåñëa
consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by
artificial repression, i s sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense
pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires.

(Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  1.2.258 )
By development of Kåñëa consciousness one can know that everything has
its use in the service of the Lord. Those who are without knowledge of Kåñëa
consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result, althoughCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.they desire liberation f rom material bondage, they do  not attain to the perfect
stage of renunciation. Their so -called renunciation is called phalgu,  or less
important. On the other hand, a person  in Kåñëa consciousness knows how to
use everything in the service of the Lord; ther efore he does not become a
victim of material consciousness. For ex ample, for an impersonalist, the Lord,
or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries
to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Kåñëa is the supreme enjoye r and
that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good
eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called prasädam.  Thus
everything becomes spiritualized, and th ere is no danger of a downfall. The
devotee takes prasäda m in Kåñëa consciousness, whereas the nondevotee
rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life, due to his
artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls
him down again into the pool of material  existence. It is said that such a soul,
even though rising up to the point of li beration, falls down again due to his not
having support in devotional service.

TRANSLATION
But a person free from all attachment and aversion and able to control his
senses through regulative principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy
of the Lord.
PURPORT
It is already explained that one may externally control the senses by some
artificial process, but unless the senses are engaged in the transcendental
service of the Lord, there is every chance  of a fall. Although the person in full
Kåñëa consciousness may  apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his
being Kåñëa conscious he has no attach ment to sensual activities. The Kåñëa
conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and nothing
else. Therefore he is transcendental to all attac hment and detachment. If
Kåñëa wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and
if Kåñëa does not want, he shall not do  that which he would have ordinarily
done for his own satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his
control because he acts only under the direction of Kåñëa. This consciousness
is the causeless mercy of the Lord, wh ich the devotee can achieve in spite of
his being attached to the sensual platform.

One who is not connected with the Supreme [in Kåñëa consciousness] can
have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there
is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?
PURPORT
Unless one is in Kåñëa consciousness, ther e is no possibility of peace. So it is
confirmed in the Fifth Chapter ( 5.29) that when one understands that Kåñëa
is the only enjoyer of all the good resu lts of sacrifice and penance, that He is
the proprietor of a ll universal manifestations, and th at He is the real friend of
all living entities, then only can one have real peace. Therefore, if one is not
in Kåñëa consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind. Disturbance
is due to want of an ultimate goa l, and when one is certain that Kåñëa is the
enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyo ne and everything, then one can, with
a steady mind, bring about peace. Ther efore, one who is engaged without a
relationship with Kåñëa is certainly always in distress and  is without peace,
however much he may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life.
Kåñëa consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be
achieved only in relationship with Kåñëa.

There are two classes of intelligent men. One is intelligent in material
activities for sense gratification, and the other is introspective and awake to
the cultivation of self-realization. Activities of the introspective sage, or
thoughtful man, are night  for persons materially absorbed. Materialistic
persons remain asleep in such a night du e to their ignorance of self-realization.
The introspective sage remains alert in  the “night” of the materialistic men.
The sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gr adual advancement of spiritual
culture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, being asleep to
self-realization, dreams of varieties of  sense pleasure, feeling sometimes happy
and sometimes distressed in his sleeping condition. The introspective man is
always indifferent to materialistic happi ness and distress. He goes on with his
self-realization activities undisturbed by material reactions.

TRANSLATION
A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter
like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still—can
alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires.
PURPORT
Although the vast ocean is always fille d with water, it is always, especially
during the rainy season, being filled with much more water. But the ocean
remains the same—steady; it is not agitat ed, nor does it cross beyond the limit
of its brink. That is al so true of a person fixed in Kåñëa consciousness. As long
as one has the material body, the demand s of the body for sense gratification
will continue. The devotee, however, is no t disturbed by such desires, because
of his fullness. A Kåñëa conscious man is  not in need of anything, because the
Lord fulfills all his material necessities. Therefore he is like the ocean—always
full in himself. Desires may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow
into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and  he is not even slightly
disturbed by desires for sense gratific ation. That is the proof of a Kåñëa
conscious man—one who has lost all inclinations for material sense
gratification, although the desires are present. Because he remains satisfied in
the tran scendental loving service of the Lo rd, he can remain steady, like the
ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace. Others, however, who want to fulfill

the person in Kåñëa consciousness is ha ppy in the service of the Lord, and he
has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not even desire liberation from
the so-called material bondage. The devotees of Kåñëa have no material
desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace.

TRANSLATION
A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free
from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false
ego—he alone can attain real peace.
PURPORT
To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification.
In other words, desire for becoming Kåñëa conscious is actually desirelessness.
To understand one’s actual position as the eternal servitor of Kåñëa, withoutCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.falsely claiming this m aterial body to be oneself and without falsely claiming
proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of Kåñëa
consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because
Kåñëa is the proprietor of everything, everything m ust be used for the
satisfaction of Kåñëa. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense
satisfaction, but when he became fully  Kåñëa conscious he fought because
Kåñëa wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for
Kåñëa the same A rjuna fought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire
for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, not an ar tificial attempt to abolish desires. The
living entity cannot be desireless or sens eless, but he does have to change the
quality of the desires. A mater ially desireless person certainly knows that
everything belongs to Kåñëa ( éçäväsyam idaà sarvam ), and therefore he does
not falsely claim proprietorship over an ything. This transcendental knowledge
is based on self-realization—namely, knowing perfectly wel l that every living
entity is an eternal part and parcel of Kåñëa in spiritual identity, and that the
eternal position of the living entity is  therefore never on the level of Kåñëa or
greater than Him. This understanding of Kåñëa consciousness is the basic
principle of real peace.

TRANSLATION
That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is
not bewildered. If one is thus situated ev en at the hour of death, one can enter
into the kingdom of God.
PURPORT
One can attain Kåñëa consciousness or divine life at once, within a
second—or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births.
It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Khaöväìga
Mahäräja attained this state of life  just a few minutes before his death, by
surrendering unto Kåñëa. Nirväëa  means ending the process of materialistic
life. According to Buddhist philosophy, th ere is only void after the completion
of this material life, but Bhagavad-gétä  teaches differently . Actual life begins
after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is
sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for
persons who are spiritually advanced , there is another life after this
materiali stic life. Before ending this life , if one fortunately becomes Kåñëa
conscious, he at once attains the stage of brahma-nirväëa.  There is no
difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the
Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute  p l a n e ,  t o  b e  e n g a g e d  i n  t h e
transcendental loving service of the Lo rd is to have attained the spiritual
kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification,
whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Kåñëa consciousness.
Attainment of Kåñëa consciousness even during this life is immediate
attainment of Brahman, and one who is  situated in Kåñëa consciousness has
certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.
Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore brähmé sthiti  means “not
on the platform of material activities .” Devotional service of the Lord isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.accepted in the Bhagavad-gétä  as the liberated stage ( sa guëän samatétyaitän
brahma-bhüyäya kalpate ). Ther efore, brähmé sthiti  is liberation from material
bondage.
Çréla Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura has summarized this Second Chapter of the
Bhagavad-gétä  as being the contents for the whole text. In the Bhagavad-gétä,
the subject matters are karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga,  and bhakti-yoga.  In the Second
Chapter karma-yoga  and jïäna-y oga have been clearly discussed, and a glimpse
of bhakti-yoga  has also been given, as the contents for the complete text.

Arjuna said: O Janärdana, O Keçava, why do You want to engage me in this

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa has very elaborately
described the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a view to
delivering His intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material grief. And
the path of realization has been re commended: buddhi-yoga,  or Kåñëa
consciousness. Sometimes Kåñëa consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia,
and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to
become fully Kåñëa conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord Kåñëa. But
without being trained in the philosophy  of Kåñëa consciousness, it is not
advisable to chant the holy name of Kå ñëa in a secluded place, where one may
acquire only cheap adoration from the i nnocent public. Arjuna also thought of
Kåñëa consciousness or buddhi-yoga,  or intelligence in spiritual advancement
of knowledge, as something like retireme nt from active life and the practice of
penance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to
skillfully avoid the fighting by using Kåñëa consc iousness as an excuse. But as a
sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned Kåñëa
as to his best course of action. In answer, Lord Kåñëa elaborately explained
karma-yoga,  or work in Kåñëa consciousness, in this Third Chapter.

PURPORT
In the previous chapter, as a prelude to the Bhagavad-gétä,  many different
paths were explained, such as säìkhya-yoga, buddhi-yoga,  control of the senses
by intelligence, work without fruitive desire, and the position of the neophyte.
This was all presente d unsystematically. A more organized outline of the path
would be necessary for action and unders tanding. Arjuna, therefore, wanted to
clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could
accept them without misinterpretation. Although Kåñëa had no intention of
confusing Arjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the
process of Kåñëa consciousness—either by inertia or by active service. In other
words, by his questions he is clearing the path of Kåñëa consciousness for all
students who seriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-gétä.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  3

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O sinless Arjuna, I have already
explained that there are two classes of men who try to realize the self. Some are
inclined to understand it by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others by
devotional service.
PURPORT
In the Second Chapter, verse 39 , the Lord explained two kinds of
procedures—namely säìkhya-yoga  and karma-yoga,  or buddhi-yoga.  In this
verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. Säìkhya-yoga,  or the analytical
study of the nature of spirit and matter , is the subject matter for persons whoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.are inclined to speculate and understa nd things by experimental knowledge
and philosophy. The other class of men wo rk in Kåñëa consciousness, as it is
explained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter . The Lord has e xplained,
also in the 39th verse , that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga,  or
Kåñëa consciousness, one can be reli eved from the bonds of action; and,
furthermore, there is no flaw in the proc ess. The same principle is more clearly
explained in the  61st verse —that this buddhi-yoga  is to depend entirely on the
Supreme (or more specifically, on Kåñëa) , and in this way all the senses can be
brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas  are
interdependent, as religion and philosophy. Reli gion without philosophy is
sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is
mental speculation. The ultimate goal is Kåñëa, because the philosophers who
are also sincerely searching after the Ab solute Truth come in the end to Kåñëa
consciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-gétä.  The whole process is to
understand the real position of the se lf in relation to the Superself. The
indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may
come to the point of Kåñ ëa consciousness; and the other process is directly
connecting with everything in Kåñëa cons ciousness. Of these two, the path of
Kåñëa consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the
senses by a philosophical process. Kåñëa consciousnes s is itself the purifying
process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously
easy and sublime.

Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction,

PURPORT
The renounced order of life can be accepted when one has been purified by
the discharge of the prescribed form of  duties which are laid down just to
purify the hearts of materialistic men. Without purification, one cannot attain
success by abruptly adoptin g the fourth order of life ( sannyäsa ). According to
the empirical philosophers, simply by adopting sannyäsa,  or retiring from
fruitive activities, one at once become s as good as Näräyaëa. But Lord Kåñëa
does not approve this principle. Without purification  of heart, sannyäsa  is
simply a disturbance to the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes
to the transcendental service of th e Lord, even without discharging his
prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted
by the Lord ( buddhi-yoga ). Sv-alpam apy asya dharmasya träyate mahato bhayät .

TRANSLATION
Everyone is forced to act helplessly according to the qualities he has acquired
from the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing
something, not even for a moment.
PURPORT
It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be
always active. Without the presence of  the spirit soul, the material body
cannot move. The body is only a dead vehi cle to be worked by the spirit soul,
which is always active and  cannot stop even for a mo ment. As such, the spirit
soul has to be engaged in the good work of Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise it
will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with
material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul
from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined
in the çästras.  But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Kåñëa
consciousness, whatever he is ab l e  t o  d o  i s  g o o d  f o r  h i m .  T h e
Çrémad- Bhägavatam  (1.5.17 ) affirms this:

“If someone takes to Kåñëa consciousn ess, even though he may not follow
the prescribed duties in the çästras  or execute the devotional service properly,
and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil
for him. But if he carries  out all the injunctions for purification in the çästras,
what does it avail him if he is not Kåñë a conscious?” So the purificatory process
is necessary for reaching this point of Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore,
sannyäsa,  o r  a n y  p u r i f i c a t o r y  p r o c e s s ,  i s  t o  help reach the ultimate goal of
becoming Kåñëa conscious, without which everything is considered a failure.

There are many pretenders who refuse to work in Kåñëa consciousness but
make a show of meditation, while actu ally dwelling within the mind upon
sense enjoyment. Such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy in order
to bluff sophisticated followers, but  according to this verse these are the
greatest cheaters. For sense enjoyment on e can act in any capacity of the social
order, but if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status, he
can make gradual progress in purifying his existence. B ut he who makes a show
of being a yogé while actually searching for th e objects of sense gratification
must be called the greatest cheater, even though he sometimes speaks of
philosophy. His knowledge has no value,  because the effects of such a sinful
man’ s knowledge are taken away by the i llusory energy of the Lord. Such a
pretender’s mind is always impure, and therefore his show of yogic meditation
has no value whatsoever.

On the other hand, if a sincere person tries to control the active senses by
the mind and begins karma-yoga [in Kåñëa consciousness] without attachment,
he is by far superior.
PURPORT
Instead of becoming a pseudo transcendentalist for the sake of wanton
living and sense enjoyment, it is far be tter to remain in one’s own business and
execute the purpose of life, which is to get free from material bondage and
enter into the kingdom of God . The prime svärtha-gati,  or goal of self-interest,
is to reach Viñëu. The whole institution of varëa  and äçrama  i s  d e s i g n e d  t o
help us reach this goal of life. A hous eholder can also reach this destination by
regulated service in Kåñëa consciousness. For self-realization, one can live a
controlled life, as prescribed in the çästras,  and continue carrying out his
business without attachment, and in that  way make progress. A sincere person
who follows this method is far bette r situated than the false pretend er who
adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public. A sincere
sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates
only for the sake of making a living.

TRANSLATION
Perform your prescribed duty, for doing so is better than not working. One
cannot even maintain one’s physical body without work.
PURPORT
There are many pseudo meditators who misrepresent themselves as
belonging to high parentage, and great professional men who falsely pose that
they have sacrificed everything for the sake of advancement in spiritual life.
Lord Kåñëa did not want Arjuna to b ecome a pretender. Rather, the Lord
desired that Arjuna perform his prescribed duties as set forth for kñatriyas.
Arjuna was a householder and a military general, and therefore it was better
for him to remain as such and pe rform his religious duties as pre scribed for the
householder kñatriya.  Such activities gradually cl eanse the heart of a mundane
man and free him from material contamin ation. So-called renunciation for the
purpose of maintenance is never approv ed by the Lord, nor by any religious
scripture . After all, one has to maintain on e’s body and soul together by some
work. Work should not be given up capriciously, without purification of
materialistic propensities. Anyone who is in the material world is certainly
possessed of the impure propensity fo r lording it over material nature, or, in
other words, for sense gratification. Such polluted propensities have to be
cleared. Without doing so, through pr escribed duties, one should never
attempt to become a so-called transcendentalist, renouncing work an d living
at the cost of others.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  9

Work done as a sacrifice for Viñëu has to be performed, otherwise work
causes bondage in this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunté, perform your
prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain
free from bondage.
PURPORT
Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the
prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that
that purpose can be fulfilled. Yajïa  means Lord Viñëu, or sacrificial
performances. All sacrificial perfo rmances also are meant for the satisfaction
of Lord Viñëu. The Vedas  enjoin: yajïo vai viñëuù.  In other words, the same
purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yajïas  or directly serves
Lord Viñëu. Kåñëa consciousness is therefore performance of yajïa  as it isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.prescribed in this verse. The varëäçrama  institution also aims at satisfying
Lord Viñëu. Varëäçramäcäravatä puruñeëa paraù pumän/ viñëur ärädhyate
(Viñëu Puräëa  3.8.8 ).
Therefore one has to work for the sa tisfaction of Viñëu. Any other work
done in this material world will be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil
work have their reactions, and any re action binds the performer. Therefore,
one has to work in Kåñëa cons ciousness to satisfy Kåñëa (or Viñëu); and while
performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of
doing work, and in the beginning this pr ocess requires very expert guidance.
One should therefore act very diligently, under t he expert guidance of a
devotee of Lord Kåñëa, or under the di rect instruction of Lord Kåñëa Himself
(under whom Arjuna had the opport unity to work). Nothing should be
performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the
satisfaction of  Kåñëa. This practice will not on ly save one from the reaction of
work, but also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the
Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God.

In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations
of men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Viñëu, and blessed them by
saying, “Be thou happy by this yajïa [sacrifice] because its performance will
bestow upon you everythin g desirable for living happily and achieving
liberation.”
PURPORT
The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Viñëu) is a chance offered
to the conditioned souls to come back home—back to Godhead. All living
entities within the material creation  are conditioned by material nature
because of their forgetfulness of the ir relationship to Viñëu, or Kåñëa, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us
understand this eternal relati on, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä:  vedaiç ca
sarvair aham eva vedyaù . The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to
understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: patià viçvasyätmeçvaram.
Therefore, the Lord of the living en tities is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Viñëu. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also ( 2.4.20 ) Çréla Çukadeva
Gosvämé describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:
çriyaù patir yajïa-patiù prajä-patir
dhiyäà patir loka-patir dharä-patiù
patir gatiç cändhaka-våñëi-sätvatäà
prasédatäà me bhagavän satäà patiù
The prajä-pati  is Lord Viñëu, and He is the Lo rd of all living creatures, all
worlds, and all beauties, and the protec tor of everyone. The Lord created this
material world to enable the condit ioned souls to learn how to perform yajïas
(sacrifices) for the satisfaction of Viñëu, so that  while in the material world
they can live very comfortably without anxiety and after finishing the present
material body they can enter into th e kingdom of God. That is the whole
program for the conditioned soul. By performan ce of yajïa,  the conditionedCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.souls gradually become Kåñëa conscious and become godly in all respects. In
the Age of Kali, the saìkértana-yajïa  (the chanting of the names of God) is
recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was
introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age.
Saìkértana-yajïa  and Kåñëa consciousness go well together. Lord Kåñëa in His
devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(11.5.32 ) as follows, with special re ference to the saìkértana-yajïa:
kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëaà
säìgopäìgästra-pärñadam
yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair
yajanti hi su-medhasaù
“In this Age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence
will worship the Lord, who is accompanie d by His associates, by performance
of saìkértana-yajïa. ” Other yajïas  prescribed in the Vedic literatures are not
easy to perform in this Age  of Kali, but the saìkértana-yajïa  is easy and
sublime for all purposes, as recommended in Bhagavad-gétä  also ( 9.14).

The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you, and thus, by
cooperation between men and demigods, prosperity will reign for all.
PURPORT
The demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The supply
of air, light, water and all other bene dictions for maintaining the body and
soul of every living entity is entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable
assistants in different par ts of the body of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Their pleasures and displeasur es are dependent on the performance
of yajïas  by the human being. Some of the yajïas  are meant to satisfy
particular demigods; but even in so doing, Lord Viñëu is worshiped  in all yajïas
as the chief beneficiary. It is stated also in the Bhagavad-gétä  that Kåñëa
Himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of yajïas:  bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäm .
Therefore, ultimate satisfaction of the yajïa-pati  is the chief purpose of all
yajïas.  Wh en these yajïas  are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in
charge of the different departments of  supply are pleased, and there is no
scarcity in the supply of natural products.
Performance of yajïas  has many side benefits, ultimately leading to
liberation from material bondage. By performance of yajïas,  all activities
become purified, as it is stated in the Vedas:  ähära-çuddhau sattva-çuddhiù
sattva-çuddhau dhruvä småtiù småti-la mbhe sarvagranthénäà vipramokñaù.  By
performance of yajïa  one’s eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified
foodstuffs one’s very existence beco mes purified; by the purification of
existence finer tissues in the memory become sanctified, and when memory is
sanctified one can think of the path of liberation, and all these combined
together lead to Kåñëa consciousness, the great necessity of present-day
society.

In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by
the performance of yajïa [sacrifice], will supply all necessities to you. But he
who enjoys such gifts without offering them to the demigods in return is
certainly a thief.
PURPORT
The demigods are authorized supplying  agents on behalf of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. Theref ore, they must be satisfied by the
performance of prescribed yajïas.  In the Vedas,  there are different kinds of
yajïas  prescribed for different kinds  of demigods, but all are ultimately offered
to the Supreme Personality of Godhea d. For one who cannot understand what
the Personality of Godhead is, sacrif ice to the demigods is recommended.
According to the different material qualities of the persons con cerned,
different types of yajïas  are recommended in the Vedas.  Worship of different
demigods is also on the same basis—namely, according to different qualities.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.For example, the meat-eaters are reco mmended to worship the goddess Kälé,
the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of
animals is recommended. But for those wh o are in the mode of goodness, the
transcendental worship of Viñëu is  recommended. But ultimately all yajïas  are
meant for gradual promotion to the transcenden tal position. For ordinary
men, at least five yajïas,  known as païca-mahä-yajïa,  are necessary.
One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human
society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can
manufacture anything. Take, for example,  all the eatables of human society.
These eatables include grains,  fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the
persons in the mode of goodness, and al so eatables for the nonvegetarians, like
meats, none of which can be manufact ured by men. Then again, take for
example heat, light, water, ai r, etc., which are also nece ssities of life—none of
them can be manufactured by the huma n society. Without the Supreme Lord,
there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without
which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on supplies from the
Lord.  Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw
materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials—all
of which are supplied by the agents of  the Lord, with the purpose that we
should make proper use of them to keep o urselves fit and healthy for the
purpose of self-realization, leading to  the ultimate goal of life, namely,
liberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained
by performance of yajïas.  If we forget the purpose of human life a nd simply
take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become
more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of
creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the
laws of material n ature. A society of thieves can never be happy, because they
have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life.
They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of
how to perform yajïas.  Lord Caitan ya, however, inaugurated the easiest
performance of yajïa,  namely the saìkértana-yajïa,  which can be performed by
anyone in the world who accepts the principles of Kåñëa consciousness.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  13

PURPORT
The devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in Kåñëa
consciousness, are called santas,  and they are always in love with the Lord as it
is described in the Brahma-saàhitä  ( 5.38):
premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vil okayanti.  The
santas,  being always in a compact of lo ve with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all pleasures), or Mukunda (the giver of
liberation), or Kåñëa (the all-attractive person), cannot accept anything
without first offering  it to the Supreme Person. Therefore, such devoteesCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.always perform yajïas  in different modes of devotional service, such as
çravaëam, kértanam, smaraëam, arcanam,  etc., and these performances of
yajïas  keep them always aloof from  all kinds of contamination  of sinful
association in the material world. Othe rs, who prepare food for self or sense
gratification, are not only thieves but al so the eaters of all kinds of sins. How
can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible.
Therefore , in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be
taught to perform the easy process of saìkértana-yajïa,  in full Kåñëa
consciousness. Otherwise, there can be no peace or happiness in the world.

Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa, a great commentator on the Bhagavad-gétä,
writes as follows: ye indrädy-aìgatayävasthitaà yajïaà sarveçvaraà viñëum
abhyarcya tac-cheñam açnanti tena ta d deha-yäträà sampädayanti, te santaù
sarveçvarasya yajïa-puruñasya bhaktäù  sarva-kilbiñair anädi-käla-vivåddhair
ätmänubhava-prati bandhakair nikhilaiù päpair vimucyante.  The Supreme Lord,
who is known as the yajïa-puruña,  or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices,
is the master of all the demigods, who serve Him as the diff erent limbs of the
body serve the whole. Demigods like In dra, Candra and Varuëa are appointed
officers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas  direct sacrifices to satisfy
these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water
suffici ently to produce food grains. When  Lord Kåñëa is worshiped, the
demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically
worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For
this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are  in Kåñëa consciousness, offer
food to Kåñëa and then eat—a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By
such action not only are past sinful re actions in the body vanquished, but the
body becomes immunized to all cont amination of material nature. When  there
is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack
of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Viñëu and then taken by
us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is
accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person
in Kåñëa consciousness, who eats only f ood offered to Kåñëa, can counteract all
reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of
self-realization. On the other han d, one who does not do so continues to
increase the volume of sinful action , and this prepares the next body to
resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The
material world is full of contamin ations, and one who is immunized by
accepting prasädam  of the Lord (food offered to Viñëu) is saved from the
attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.
Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats
different kinds of food grains, vegetabl es, fruits, etc., and the animals eat theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who
are accustomed to eating  meat and flesh must also depend on the production of
vegetation in order to eat the animal s. Therefore, ultimately, we have to
depend on the production of the fiel d and not on the production of big
factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain  from the sky, and such
rains are controlled by demigods like In dra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all
servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one
who cannot perform them will find hims elf in scarcity—that is the law of
nature. Yajïa,  specifically the saìkértana-yajïa  prescribed for this age, must
therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.

Yajïärtha-karma,  or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of Kåñëa only,
is more expressly stated in this verse. If  we have to work for the satisfaction of
the yajïa-puruña,  V i ñ ë u ,  t h e n  w e  m u s t  f i n d  o u t  t h e  d i r e c t i o n  o f  w o r k  i n
Brahman, or the transce ndental Vedas.  The Vedas  are therefore codes of
working directions. Anything perfor med without the direction of the Vedas  is
called vikarma,  or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always
take direction from the Vedas  to be saved from the rea ction of work. As one
has to work in ordinary life by the di rection of the state, one similarly has to
work under direction of the supreme stat e of the Lord. Such directions in the
Vedas  are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. It is said, asya mahato bhütasya niçvasitam etad yad åg-vedo
yajur-vedaù sämavedo ’tharväìgirasaù.  “The four Vedas —namely the Åg Veda,
Yajur Veda, Säma Veda,  and Atharva Veda —are all emanations from the
breathing of the great Personality of Go dhead.” ( Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad
4.5.11 ) The Lord, being omnipotent, can sp eak by breathing air, for as it is
confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä,  the Lord has the omnipotence to perform
through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other word s, the
Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In
fact, it is said that He glanced over ma terial nature and thus fathered all living
entities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb
of material n ature, He gave His directions in  the Vedic wisdom as to how such
conditioned souls can return home, ba ck to Godhead. We should always
remember that the conditioned souls in  material nature are all eager for
material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy
one’s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called
enjoyment. It is a chance for the co nditioned souls to attain liberation;
therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yajïa  by
becoming Kåñëa conscious. Even those who have not followed the Vedic
injunctions may adopt the principles of Kåñëa consciousness, and that will take
the place of performance of Vedic yajïas,  or karmas.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  16

My dear Arjuna, one who does not follow in human life the cycle of sacrifice

PURPORT
The mammonist philosophy of “work very hard and enjoy sense
gratification” is condemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want
to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yajïas  is
absolutely necessary. One who does not  follow such regulations is living a very
risky life, being condemned more and mo re. By nature’s law, this human form
of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three
ways—namely karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga,  or bhakti-yoga.  There is no  necessity of
rigidly following the performances of the prescribed yajïas  for theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged
in sense gratification require purifica tion by the above mentioned cycle of
yajïa  performances. Th ere are different kinds of activities. Those who are not
Kåñëa conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they
need to execute pious work. The yajïa  system is planned in such a way that
sensory conscious persons may satisfy their d esires without becoming
entangled in the reaction of sense-grati ficatory work. The prosperity of the
world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of
the Supreme Lord, directly carried ou t by the demigods. Therefore, the yajïas
are directly aimed at the particul ar demigods mentioned in the Vedas.
Indirectly, it is the practice of Kåñëa consciousness, because when one masters
the performance of yajïas  one is sure to become Kåñëa conscious. But if by
performing yajïas  one does not bec ome Kåñëa conscious, such principles are
counted as only moral codes. One should  not, therefore, limit his progress only
to the point of moral codes, but shou ld transcend them, to attain Kåñëa
consciousness.

therefore he no longer has any obligations to the Vedic injunctions. Such a
Kåñëa conscious person is no longer in terested in material activities and no
longer takes pleasure in material arrangements like wine, women and similar
infatuations.

The Supreme is the Personality of Go dhead for the devotees, and liberation
for the impersonalist. A person, theref ore, acting for Kåñëa, or in Kåñëa
consciousness, under proper guidance an d without attachment to the result of
the work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life. Arjuna
is told that he should fight in the Battle of Kurukñetra for the interest of Kåñëa
because Kåñëa wanted him to fight. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a
personal attachment, but to act on behalf of th e Supreme is to act without
attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree,
recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa.
Vedic rituals, like prescribed sacrifices, are performed for purification of
impious activities that were performed in the field of sense gratification. But
action in Kåñëa consciousness is transcen dental to the reactions of good or evil
work. A Kåñëa cons cious person has no attachment for the result but acts on
behalf of Kåñëa alone. He engages in a ll kinds of activities, but is completely
nonattached.

TRANSLATION
Kings such as Janaka attained perfectio n solely by performance of prescribed
duties. Therefore, just for the sake of  educating the people in general, you
should perform your work.
PURPORT
Kings like Janaka were all self-realized souls; consequently they had no
obligation to perform the prescribed duties in the Vedas.  Nonetheless they
performed all prescribed activities ju st to set examples for the people in
general. Janaka was the father of  Sétä and father-in-law of Lord Çré Räma.
Being a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcendentally situated, but
because he was the king of Mithilä (a su bdivision of Bihar province in India),
he had to teach his subjects how to perform prescribed duties.  Lord Kåñëa and
Arjuna, the Lord’s eternal friend, ha d no need to fight in the Battle of
Kurukñetra, but they fought to teach pe ople in general that violence is also
necessary in a situation where good arguments fail. Before the Battle of
Kurukñetra, every  effort was made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but the other pa rty was determined to fight. So for
such a right cause, there is a necessity for fighting. Although one who is
situated in Kåñëa consciousness may not have any i nterest in the world, he still
works to teach the public how to live and how to act. Experienced persons in
Kåñëa consciousness can act in such a way that others will follow, and this isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.explained in the following verse.

TRANSLATION
Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever
standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.
PURPORT
People in general always require a leader who can teach the public by
practical behavior. A leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he
himself smokes. Lord Caitanya said th at a teacher should behave properly
before he begins teaching. One who tea ches in that way is called äcärya,  or the
ideal teacher. Therefore, a teache r must follow the principles of çästra
(scripture) to teach the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules
against the principles of revealed  scriptures. The revealed scriptu res, like
Manu-saàhitä  and similar others, are considered the standard books to beCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.followed by human society. Thus the leader’s teaching should be based on the
principles of such standard çästras.  One who desires to improve himself must
follow the standard  rules as they are practiced by the great teachers. The
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also affirms that one should follow in the footsteps of great
devotees, and that is the way of progress on the path of spiritual realization.
The king or the executive head of a stat e, the father and the school teacher are
all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in general. All such
natural leaders have a great responsibili ty to their dependents; therefore they
must be conversant with standard books of moral and sp iritual codes.

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in the Vedic literatures

“The Supreme Lord is the controller of  all other controllers, and He is the
greatest of all the diverse planetary leaders. Everyone is under His control. All
entities are delegated with particular power only by the Supreme Lord; they
are not supreme themse lves. He is also worshipable by all demigods and is the
supreme director of all directors. Therefore, He is transcendental to all kinds
of material leaders and controllers and is worshipable by all. There is no one
greater than Him, and He is the supreme c ause of all causes.
“He does not possess bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity.
There is no difference between His body and His soul. He is absolute. All His
senses are transcendental. Any one of His senses can perform the action of
any other sense. Therefore, no  one is greater than Him or equal to Him. His
potencies are multifarious, and thus His deeds are automatically performed as a
natural sequence.” ( Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  6.7–8 )
Since everything is in full opulence in the Personality of Godhead and is
existing in full truth, there is no duty  for the Supreme Personality of Godhead
to perform. One who must receive the results of work has some designated
duty, but one who has nothing  to achieve within the three planetary systems
certainly has no duty. And yet Lord Kå ñëa is engaged on the Battlefield of
Kurukñetra as the leader of the kñatriyas  because the kñatriyas  are duty-bound
to give protection to the distressed. Although He is ab ove all the regulations of
the revealed scriptures, He does not do  anything that violates the revealedCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.scriptures.

If I did not perform prescribed duties, all these worlds would be put to

PURPORT
Varëa-saìkara  is unwanted population whic h disturbs the peace of the
general society. In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed
rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become
peaceful and organized for spiritua l progress in life. When Lord Kåñëa
descends, naturally He deals with such rules and regulations in order to
maintain the prestige and necessity of  such important performances. The Lord
is the father of all living entities , and if the living entities are m isguided,
indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.general disregard of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and
corrects the society. We should, however, note carefully that although we have
to follow in the  footsteps of the Lord, we st ill have to remember that we
cannot imitate Him. Following and imit ating are not on the same level. We
cannot imitate the Lord by lifting Gova rdhana Hill, as the Lord did in His
childhood. It is impossible for any human being. We have to follow His
instructions, but we may not imitate Him at any time. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(10.33.30–31 ) affirms:
naitat samäcarej jätu

“One should simply follow the instruct ions of the Lord and His empowered

perform them as instructed. However, one should guard against trying to
imitate their actions. One sh ould not try to drink the ocean of poison in
imitation of Lord Çiva.”
We should always consider the position of the éçvaras,  or those who can
actually control the movements of th e sun and moon, as superior. Without
such power, one cannot imitate the éçvaras,  who are superpowerful. Lord Çiva
drank poison to the extent of swal lowing an ocean, but if any common man
tries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many

So as not to disrupt the minds of ignorant men attached to the fruitive

PURPORT
Vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù . That is the end of all Vedic rituals. All
rituals, all performances of sacrifices , and everything that is put into theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Vedas,  including all direction for material activities, are meant for
understanding Kåñëa, who is the ultimate goal of life. But because the
conditioned souls do not know anything beyond sense gratification, they study
the Vedas  to that end. But through fruitive activities and sense gratification
regulated by the Vedic rituals one is gradually elevated to Kåñëa consciousness.
Therefore a realized soul in Kåñëa consciousness should not disturb others in
their activities or understanding, but he should act by showing how the results
of all work can be dedicated to the service of Kåñëa. The learned Kåñëa
consc ious person may act in such a way that the ignorant person working for
sense gratification may learn how to act and how to behave. Although the
ignorant man is not to be disturbed in his activities, a slightly developed Kåñëa
conscious person may directly be engaged in the service of the Lord without
waiting for other Vedic formulas. For th is fortunate man there is no need to
follow the Vedic rituals, because by di rect Kåñëa consciousness one can have
all the results one would otherwise derive from followin g one’s prescribed
duties.

The spirit soul bewildered by the infl uence of false ego thinks himself the

PURPORT
Two persons, one in Kåñëa consci ousness and the other in material
consciousness, working on the same level, may appear to be working on the
same platform, but there is a wide gu lf of difference in their respective
positions. The person in material consciou sness is convinced by false ego that
he is the doer of everything. He does  not know that the mechanism of the
body is produced by material nature, which works under the supervision of the
Supreme Lord. The materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimat ely he is
under the control of Kåñëa. The person in false ego takes all credit for doing
everything independently, and that is the symptom of his nescience. He does
not know that this gross and subtle body is the creation of material nature,
under the orde r of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such his bodily
and mental activities should be engage d in the service of Kåñëa, in Kåñëa
consciousness. The ignorant man forg ets that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is known as Håñékeça, or the master of  the senses of the material
body, for due to his long misuse of th e senses in sense gratification, he is
factually bewildered by the false ego,  which makes him forget his eternal

PURPORT
The knower of the Absolute Truth is convinced of his awkward position in
material association. He knows that he  is part and parcel of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and that his position should not be in the
material creation. He knows his real  identity as part and parcel of the
Supreme, who is eternal bliss and knowle dge, and he realizes that somehow or
other he is entrapped in the material co nception of life. In his pure state of
existence he is meant to dovetail  his activities in devotional s ervice to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.  He therefore engages himself in the
activities of Kåñëa consciousness and becomes naturally unattached to the
activities of the material senses, whic h are all circumstantial and temporary.
He knows that his material condition of life is under the supreme control of
the Lord; consequently he is not distur bed by all kinds of material reactions,
which he considers to be the mercy of the Lord. According to
Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  one who knows the Absolute Truth i n three different
features—namely Brahman, Paramätm ä, and the Supreme Personality ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Godhead—is called tattva-vit,  for he knows also his own factual position in

is called manda,  or a lazy pe rson without understanding of spirit soul. IgnorantCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.men think of the body as the self; they accept bodily connections with others
as kinsmanship, the land in which the body is obtained is their object of
worship, and they consider the formalities of religi ous rituals to be ends in
themselves. Social work, nationalism and altruism are some of the activities for
such materially designated persons. Un der the spell of such designations, they
are always busy in the material fi eld; for them spiritual realization is a myth,
and so they are not interested. Those who are enlightened in spiritual life,
however, should not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to
prosecute one’s own spiritual activities silently. Such bewildered persons may
be engage d in such primary moral principles of life as nonviolence and similar
materially benevolent work.
Men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in Kåñëa consciousness,
and therefore Lord Kåñëa advises us no t to disturb them and simply waste
valuable time. But the devotees of th e Lord are more kind than the Lord
because they understand the purpose o f the Lord. Consequently they
undertake all kinds of risks, even to the point of approaching ignorant men to
try to engage them in the acts of Kå ñëa consciousness, which are absolutely
necessary for the human being.

TRANSLATION
Therefore, O Arjuna, surrendering all your works unto Me, with full
knowledge of Me, without desires for profit, with no claims to proprietorship,
and free from lethargy, fight.
PURPORT
This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-gétä.  The Lord
instructs that one has to become fully Kå ñëa conscious to discharge duties, as if
in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult;
nevertheless duties mus t be carried out, with dependence on Kåñëa, because
that is the constitutional position of th e living entity. The living entity cannot
be happy independent of the cooperat ion of the Supreme Lord, because the
eternal constitutional position of the living en tity is to become subordinate to
the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was theref ore ordered by Çré Kåñëa to fight as if
the Lord were his military commander. On e has to sacrifice everything for the
good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge p rescribed
duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the
order of the Lord; he had only to exec ute His order. The Supreme Lord is the
soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme
Soul without p ersonal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully Kåñëa
conscious, is called adhyätma-cetas.  Niräçéù  means that one has to act on the
order of the master but should not expe ct fruitive results. The cashier may
count millions of dollars for his emp loyer, but he does not claim a cent for
himself. Similarly, one has to realize th at nothing in the world belongs to any
individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is
the real purport of mayi,  or “unto Me.” And when one acts in  such Kåñëa
consciousness, certainly he does not cl aim proprietorship over anything. This
consciousness is called nirmama,  or “nothing is mine.” And if there is anyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.reluctance to execute such a stern or der, which is without consideration of
so-called kinsm en in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown
off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara,  or without feverish mentality or
lethargy. Everyone, according to his qual ity and position, has a particular type
of work to discharge, and all su c h  d u t i e s  m a y  b e  d i s c h a r g e d  i n  K å ñ ë a

The injunction of the Supreme Person ality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.essence of all Vedic wisdom and therefore is eternally true without exception.
As the Vedas  are eternal, so this truth of Kå ñëa consciousness is also eternal.
One should have firm faith in  this injunction, without envying the Lord.
There are many philosophers who write comments on the Bhagavad-gétä  but
have no faith in Kåñëa. They will ne ver be liberated from the bondage of
fruitive action. But an ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal  injunctions
of the Lord, even though unable to execute such orders, becomes liberated
from the bondage of the law of karma.  In the beginning of Kåñëa
consciousness, one may not fully discha rge the injunctions of the Lord, but
because one is not resentful of this principle and works sincerely without
consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely be promoted to the
stage of pure Kåñëa consciousness.

PURPORT
Unless one is situated on the tr anscendental platform of Kåñëa
consciousness, he cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material
nature, as it is confirmed by th e Lord in the Seventh Chapter ( 7.14).
Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it
is impossible to get out of the entanglement of mäyä  simply by theoretical
knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body. There are many so-called
spiritualists who outwardly pose as advanced in the science but inwardly  or
privately are completely under particular modes of nature which they are
unable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his
long association with material nature, he is in bondage. Kåñëa consciousness
helps one to get out of t he material entanglement, even though one may be
engaged in his prescribed duties in te rms of material existence. Therefore,
without being fully in Kåñëa consciousness, one should not give up his
occupational duties. No one should suddenly give up his pres cribed duties and
become a so-called yogé or transcendentalist artificially. It is better to be
situated in one’s position and to tr y to attain Kåñëa consciousness under
superior training. Thus one may be freed from the clutches of Kåñëa’s mäyä.

There are principles to regulate attach ment and aversion pertaining to the
senses and their objects. One should not come under the control of such
attachment and aversion, because they are stumbling blocks on the path of
self-realization.
PURPORT
Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in
material sense gratification. But those who are not in such consciousness
should follow the rules and regulations of  the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted
sense enjoyment is the caus e of material encagement, but one who follows the
rules and regulations of the revealed sc riptures does not become entangled by
the sense objects. For example, se x enjoyment is a necessity for the
conditioned soul, and sex enjo yment is allowed under the li cense of marriage
ties. According to scriptural injunction s, one is forbidden to engage in sex
relationships with any women other than one’s wife. All other women are to
be considered as one’s mother. But in sp ite of such injunctions, a man is still
inclin ed to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to
be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of
self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the
material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should
not rely upon the control of such allo wances. One has to follow those rules and
regulations, unattached to them, becaus e practice of sense gratification under
regulations may also lead one to go astray—as much as t here is always the
chance of an accident, even on the ro yal roads. Although they may be very
carefully maintained, no one can guaran tee that there will be no danger evenCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long,
long time , owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense
enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment
for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But
attachment to Kåñëa consciousness, or ac ting always in the loving service of
Kåñëa, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one
should try to be detached from Kåñëa consciousness at any stage of life. The
whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately
to become situated on the platform of Kåñëa consciousness.

One should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full Kåñëa
consciousness rather than those prescribed for others. Materially, prescribed
duties are duties enjoined according to  one’s psychophysical condition, under
the spell of the modes of materia l nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the
spiritual master for the transcendental service of Kåñëa. But whether material
or spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather
than imitate another’s prescribed duties. Dutie s on the spiritual platform and
duties on the material platform may be  different, but the principle of following
the authorized direction is always good  for the performer. When one is under
the spell of the modes of material  nature, one should follow the p rescribed
rules for his particular situation and sh ould not imitate others. For example, a
brähmaëa,  who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a kñatriya,
who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a kñatriya  it
is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a
brähmaëa  who follows the principles of nonv iolence. Everyone has to cleanse
his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends
the modes of material nature and  is fully situated in Kåñëa consciousness, he
can perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide
spiritual master. In that complete stage of Kåñëa consciousness, the kñatriya
may act as a brähmaëa,  or a brähmaëa  may act as a kñatriya.  In the
transcendental stage, the distinctions of  the material world do not apply. For
example, Viçvämitra was originally a kñatriya,  but later on he acted as a
brähmaëa,  whereas Paraçuräma was a brähmaëa  but later on he acted as a
kñatriya.  Being transcende ntally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is
on the material platform, he must perf orm his duties according to the modes of
material nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense of Kåñëa
consciousness.

PURPORT
A living entity, as part and parcel of the Supreme, is originally spiritual,
pure, and free from all material contaminat ions. Therefore, by nature he is not
subject to the sins of the material worl d. But when he is in contact with the
material nature, he a cts in many sinful ways without hesitation, and sometimes
even against his will. As such, Arjuna’s question to Kåñëa is very sanguine, as
to the perverted nature of the living  entities. Although the living entity
sometimes does not want to act in sin, he i s still forced to act. Sinful actions
are not, however, impelled by the Supe rsoul within, but are due to another
cause, as the Lord explains in the next verse.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  37

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is
born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into
wrath, and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.
PURPORT
When a living entity comes in cont act with the material creation, his
eternal love for Kåñëa is transformed into  lust, in association with the mode of
passion. Or, in other words, the sense of  love of God becomes transformed into
lust, as milk in contact w ith sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then
again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turn s into wrath; wrath is transformed into
illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.greatest enemy of the living entity, and it i s lust only which induces the pure
living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the
manifestation of the mode of ignoranc e; these modes exhibit themselves as
wrath and other corollaries. If, therefor e, the mode of passion, instead of b eing
degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by
the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the
degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead ex panded Himself into many for His
ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of
this spiritual bliss. They also have part ial independence, but by misuse of their
independence, when the  service attitude is transformed into the propensity for
sense enjoyment, they come under the sw ay of lust. This material creation is
created by the Lord to give facility to  the conditioned souls to fulfill these
lustful propensities, and when completely b affled by prolonged lustful
activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.
This inquiry is the beginning of the Vedänta-sütras,  wherein it is said,
athäto brahma jijïäsä : one should inquire into th e Supreme. And the Supreme
is defined in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  as janmädy asya yato ’nvayäd itarataç ca , or,
“The origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman.” Therefore the origin of
lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the
Supreme, or transformed into Kåñë a consciousness—or, in other words,
desiring everything for Kåñëa—then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized.
Hanumän, the great servitor of Lord Rä ma, exhibited his wrath by burning the
golden city of Rävaëa, but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the
Lord. Here also, in Bhagavad-gétä,  the Lord induces Arjuna to engage his wrath
upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath,
when they are employed in Kåñëa consciousness, become our friends instead of
our enemies.

As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirro r is covered by dust, or as the embryo
is covered by the womb, the living en tity is similarly covered by different
degrees of this lust.
PURPORT
There are three degrees of covering of  the living entity by which his pure
consciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different
manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about
the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of
the living spark can be a little percei ved. In other words, when the living
entity exhibits his Kåñëa consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire
covered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there  is smoke, there is no
overt manifestation of fire in the early st age. This stage is like the beginning of
Kåñëa consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of
the mirror of the mind by so many sp iritual methods. The best process is  to
chant the holy names of the Lord. Th e embryo covered by the womb is an
analogy illustrating a helpless position, fo r the child in the womb is so helplessCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.that he cannot even move. This stage of  living condition can be compared to
that of the trees. The  trees are also living entities, but they have been put in
such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost
void of all consciousness. The covere d mirror is compared to the birds and
beasts, and the smoke-covered fire is com pared to the human being. In the
form of a human being, the living  entity may revive a little Kåñëa
consciousness, and, if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life
can be kindled in the human form of li fe. By careful handling of the smoke i n
the fire, fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a
chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence.
In the human form of life, one can conq uer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of
Kåñëa consciousness un der able guidance.

PURPORT
It is said in the Manu-småti  that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount of
sense enjoyment, just as fire is never ex tinguished by a constant supply of fuel.
In the material world, the center of all activities is sex, and thus this material
world is called  maithunya-ägära,  or the shackles of sex life. In the ordinary
prison house, criminals are kept within  bars; similarly, the criminals who are
disobedient to the laws of the Lord ar e shackled by sex life. Advancement of
material civilization on the basis of  sense gratification means increasing the
duration of the material existence of a li ving entity. Therefore, this lust is the
symbol of ignorance by which the living  entity is kept within the material
world. While one enjoys sense gratification, it may be t hat there is some
feeling of happiness, but actually that  so-called feeling of happiness is the
ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer.

The senses, the mind and the intelligence  are the sitting places of this lust.
Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders
him.
PURPORT
The enemy has captured different stra tegic positions in the body of the
conditioned soul, and therefore Lord Kåñë a is giving hints of those places, so
that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found.
Mind is the center of all the act ivities of the senses, and thus when we hear
about sense objects the mind generally becomes a reservoir of all ideas of sense
gratification; and, as a result, the mind  and the senses become the repositories
of lust. Next, the intelligence department become s the capital of such lustful
propensities. Intelligence is the immediate next-door neighbor of the spirit
soul. Lusty intelligence influences the sp irit soul to acquire the false ego and
identify itself with matter, and thus with the mind and senses. The spirit soul
becomes addicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true
happiness. This false identification of the spirit soul is very nicely explained in
the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.84.13 ):
yasyätma-buddhiù kuëape tri-dhätuke

Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bhäratas, in the very beginning curb this

knowledge and self-realization.
PURPORT
The Lord advised Arjuna to regulate the senses from the very beginning so
that he could curb the greatest sinful enemy, lust, which destroys the urge for
self-realization and specific knowledge of the self. Jïäna  refers to knowledge of
self as distinguishe d from non-self, or in other wo rds, knowledge that the spirit
soul is not the body. Vijïäna  refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul’s
constitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is
explained thus in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.9.31):
jïänaà parama-guhyaà me

“The knowledge of the self and Supr eme Self is very confidential and
mysterious, but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if
explained with their various aspects by the Lord Himself.” Bhagavad-gétä  gives
us that general and specific kn owledge of the self. The living entities are parts
and parcels of the Lord, and therefore th ey are simply meant to serve the Lord.
This consciousness is called Kåñëa consciousness. So, from the very beginning
of life one has to learn this Kåñëa consciousne ss, and thereby one may become
fully Kåñëa conscious and act accordingly.
Lust is only the perverted reflection of  the love of God which is natural for
every living entity. But if one is educat ed in Kåñëa consciousness from the very
beginning, that natural love of God canno t deteriorate into lust. When love of
God deteriorates i nto lust, it is very difficult to  return to the normal condition.
Nonetheless, Kåñëa consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can
become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional
service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its
urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in Kåñëa consciousness,
devotional service of the Lord, and turn  the lust into love of Godhead—the
highest perfectional stage of human life.

TRANSLATION
The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the
senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even
higher than the intelligence.
PURPORT
The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved
within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses
are superior to the body as a whole. Th ese outlets are not in use when there is
superior conscious ness, or Kåñëa consciousness. In Kåñëa consciousness the
soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
therefore the hierarchy of bodily functions, as described here, ultimately ends
in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the func tions of the senses, and
stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is
active, then even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will
act—as it does during dreaming. But above the mind is the determination of
the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the
soul is directly engaged with the Supr eme, naturally all other subordinates,
namely, the intelligence, mind and senses, will be automatically engaged. In
the Kaöha Upaniñad  there is a similar passage, in which it is said that the
objects of sense gratification are superior  to the senses, and mind is superior to

With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul
and then engage the mind always in Kåñëa consciousness. That solves the
whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from
the objects of the senses. But aside from that, one has to strengthen the mind
by use of intelligence. If by intelli gence one engages one’s mind in Kåñëa
consciousness, by complete surrend er unto the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and  even though
the senses are very strong, like serpen ts, they will be no more effective than
serpents with broken fangs. But even  though the soul is the master of
intelligence and mind, and the senses also , still, unless it is strengthened by
association wi th Kåñëa in Kåñëa consciousness, there is every chance of falling
down due to the agitated mind.

Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to the material senses, mind and
intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate
spiritual intelligence [Kåñëa consciousness] and thus—by spiritual
strength—conquer this insatiable ene my known as lust.
PURPORT
This Third Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä  is conclusively directive to Kåñëa
consciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, without considering impersonal voidness the ultimate
end. In the material existence o f life, one is certainly influenced by
propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material
nature. Desire for overlording and for sense gratification is the greatest enemy
of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of Kåñëa consciou sness, one can
control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give
up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing
Kåñëa consciousness, one can be situated  in a transcendental position without
being influ enced by the material senses and the mind—by steady intelligence
directed toward one’s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the
immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial
attempts to control the sens es by the so-called practice of yogic postures can
never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in Kåñëa
consciousness by higher intelligence.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Third Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Karma-yoga,  or the Discharge of One’s Prescribed
Duty in Kåñëa Consciousness.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.- CHAPTER 4 -

Herein we find the history of the Bhagavad-gétä  traced from a remote time
when it was delivered to the royal order of all planets, beginning from the sun
planet. The kings of all planets are espe cially meant for the protection of the
inhabitants, and there fore the royal order should understand the science of
Bhagavad-gétä  i n  o r d e r  t o  b e  a b l e  t o  r u l e  the citizens and protect them from
material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual
knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Suprem e Personality of Godhead,
and the executive heads of all states an d all planets are obliged to impart this
lesson to the citizens by education, cu lture and devotion. In other words, the
executive heads of all states are in tended to spread the science of Kå ñëa
consciousness so that the people may ta ke advantage of this great science and
pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.
In this millennium, the sun-god is know n as Vivasvän, the king of the sun,
which is the origin of all planet s within the solar system. In the
Brahma-saàhitä  (5.52) it is stated:
yac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäà
räjä samasta-sura-mürtir açeña-tejäù
yasyäjïayä bhramati sambhåta-käla-cakro
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
“Let me worship,” Lord Brahmä said, “the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Govinda [Kåñëa], who is the original person and under whose order the sun,
which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun
represents the eye of the Lord  and traverses its orbit in obedience to His
order.”
The sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name
Vivasvän) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by
supplying heat and light. He is rotati ng under the order of Kåñëa, and Lord
Kåñëa originally made Vivasvän  His first disciple to understand the science of
Bhagavad-gétä.  The Gétä is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the
insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge comingCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.down from time immemorial.
In the Mahäbhärata  (Çänti-parva  348.51–52 ) we can trace out the history of
the Gétä as follows:
tretä-yugädau ca tato
vivasvän manave dadau
manuç ca loka-bhåty-arthaà
sutäyekñväkave dadau
ikñväkuëä ca kathito
vyäpya lokän avasthitaù
“In the beginning of the millennium kn own as Tretä-yuga this science of
the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvän to Manu. Manu,
being the father of mankind, gave it to  his son Mahäräja Ikñväku, the king of
this earth planet and forefathe r of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord
Rämacandra appeared.” Therefore, Bhagavad-gétä  existed in human society
from the time of Mahäräja Ikñväku.
At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of
the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dväpara-yuga
(800,000 years), and before that there was Tretä-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus,
some 2,005,000 years ago, M anu spoke the Bhagavad-gétä  to his disciple and son
Mahäräja Ikñväku, the king of this pl anet earth. The age of the current Manu
is calculated to last some 305,3 00,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed.
Accepting that before the birth of Manu the Gétä was spoken by the Lord to
His disciple the sun-god Vivasvän, a rough estimate is that the Gétä was spoken
at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in huma n society it has been extant for two
million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about fiv e thousand
years ago. That is the rough es timate of the history of the Gétä,  according to
the Gétä itself and according to the versio n of the speaker, Lord Çré Kåñëa. It
was spoken to the sun-god Vivasvän because he is also a kñatriya  and is the
father of all kñatriyas  who are descendants of the sun-god, or the sürya-vaàça
kñatriyas.  Because Bhagavad-gétä  is as good as the Vedas,  being spoken by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauruñeya,  superhuman.
Since the Vedic instructions are ac cepted as they are, without humanCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.interpretation, the Gétä must therefore be accepted without mundane
interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the Gétä in their
own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-gétä  as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-gétä  has to
be accepted as it is, from the discip lic succession, and it is described herein
that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu and
Manu spoke to his son Ikñväku.

This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic

time the succession was broken, and theref ore the science as it is appears to be
lost.
PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.It is clearly stated that the Gétä was especially meant for the saintly kings
because they were to execute its purpos e in ruling over the citizens. Certainly
Bhagavad-gétä  was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate
its value for no one’s benefit and would devise all types of interpretations
according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by
the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to
reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand ye ars ago it was detected by
the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He
declared that the purpose of the Gétä appeared to be lost. In the same way, at
the present moment also there are so many editions of the Gétä (especially  in
English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic
succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different
mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, althoug h they make a good business on the
words of Çré Kåñëa. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in
God but simply enjoy the property of th e Supreme. Since there is a great need
of an edition of the Gétä in English, as it is received by the paramparä
(disciplic succession) system, an attempt is  made herewith to fulfill this great
want. Bhagavad-gétä —accepted as it is—is a great boon to humanity; but if it is
accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time.

PURPORT
There are two classes of men, namely the devotee and the demon. The Lord
selected Arjuna as the recipient of th is great science owing to his being a
devotee of the Lord, but for the demon it is not possible to understand this
great mysterious science. Ther e are a number of editions of this great book of
knowledge. Some of them have commentaries by the devotees, and some of
them have commentaries by the demo ns. Commentation by the devotees is
real, whereas that of the demons is useless. Arjuna accepts Çré Kå ñëa as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and any commentary on the Gétä following
in the footsteps of Arjuna is real devoti onal service to the cause of this great
science. The demonic, however, do not accept Lord Kåñëa as He is. Instead
they concoct some thing about Kåñëa and mislead general readers from the
path of Kåñëa’s instructions. Here is a warning about such misleading paths.
One should try to follow the discipli c succession from Arjuna, and thus be
benefitted by this great science of Çrémad Bhagav ad-gétä.

Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvän is senior by birth to You. How am I to

PURPORT
Arjuna is an accepted devotee of th e Lord, so how could he not believe
Kåñëa’s words? The fact is that Arjuna  is not inquiring for himself but for
those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the
demons who do not like the idea tha t Kåñëa should be accepted as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he
were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or Kåñëa. As it will be
evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well  that Kåñëa is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fo untainhead of everything and the last
word in transcendence. Of course, Kåñëa also appeared as the son of Devaké on
this earth. How Kåñëa remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead,
the eternal  original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand.
Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna  put this question before Kåñëa so thatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.He Himself could speak authoritatively. That Kåñëa is the supreme authority is
accepted by the whole worl d, not only at present but from time immemorial,
and the demons alone reject Him. An yway, since Kåñëa is the authority
accepted by all, Arjuna put this questi on before Him in order that Kåñëa would
describe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who  always try to
distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is
necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of Kåñëa.
Therefore, when Kåñëa Himself speaks ab out Himself, it is auspicious for all
the worlds. T o the demons, such explanations by Kåñëa Himself may appear to
be strange because the demons always study Kåñëa from their own standpoint,
but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of Kåñëa when
they are spoken by Kåñëa Himself. The devote es will always worship such
authoritative statements of Kåñëa becaus e they are always eager to know more
and more about Him. The atheists, who consider Kåñëa an ordinary man, may
in this way come to know that Kåñëa is superhuman, that He is
sac-cid-änanda- vigraha  [Bs. 5.1]—the eternal form of bliss and
knowledge—that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination
of the modes of material nature and ab ove the influence of time and space. A
devotee of Kåñëa, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any mi sunderstanding of
the transcendental position of Kåñëa. Ar juna’s putting this question before the
Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of
persons who consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary human being, subject to the
modes of m aterial nature.

PURPORT
In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.33) we have information of many, many
incarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:
advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam
ädyaà puräëa-puruñaà nava-yauvanaà ca
vedeñu durlabham adurlabham ätma-bhaktau
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
“I worship the Supreme Personality of  Godhead, Govinda [Kåñëa], who is
the original person—absolute, infallible, without beginning. Although
expanded into unlimited forms, He is st ill the same original, the oldest, and the
person always appearing as a fres h youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing
forms of the Lord are usually understood by the best Vedic scholars, but they
are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.”
It is also stated in Brahma-saàhitä  (5.39):
rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan
nänävatäram akarod bhuvaneñu kintu
kåñëaù svayaà samabhavat paramaù pumän yoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
“I worship the Supreme Personality of  Godhead, Govinda [Kåñëa], who is
always situated in various incarnations such as Räma, Nåsiàha and many
subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known
as Kåñëa, and who incarnates persona lly also.”
In the Vedas  also it is said that the Lord , although one without a second,
manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidurya  stone, which
changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the
pure, unalloyed devotees , but not by a simple study of the Vedas  (vedeñu
durlabham adurlabham ätma-bhaktau ). Devotees like Arjuna are constant
companions of the Lord, and whenever  the Lord incarnates, the associate
devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different c apacities.
Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some
millions of years ago when Lord Kåñëa spoke the Bhagavad-gétä  to the sun-god
Vivasvän, Arjuna, in a different capacity , was also present. But the difference
between th e Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident
whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the
part-and-parcel living entity and th e Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is
addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the  enemies, he is
unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a
living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never
equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is
certainly a l iberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is
described in the Brahma-saàhitä  as infallible ( acyuta ), which means that He
never forgets Himself, even though He is  in material contact. Therefore, the
Lord and the living entity can never b e equal in all respects, even if the living
entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Althou gh Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he
sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord , but by the divine grace a devotee can
at once understand the infallible condition of the Lo rd, whereas a nondevotee
or a demon cannot understand this tran scendental nature. Consequently these
descriptions in the Gétä cannot be understood by demonic brains. Kåñëa
remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but
Arjuna cou ld not, despite the fact that both Kåñëa and Arjuna are eternal inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to
his change of body, but the Lord reme mbers because He does not change His
sac-cid-änanda  body. He is advaita,  which means there is no distinction
between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is
spirit—whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And
because the Lord’s body and self are iden tical, His position is always different
from that of the ordinary living entity , even when He descends to the material
platform. The demons cannot adjust them selves to this transcendental nature
of the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse.

The Lord has spoken about the peculiar ity of His birth: although He may
appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many
past “births,” whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done
even a few hours before. If someone is as ked what he did exactly at the same
time one day earlier, it would be very  difficult for a common man to answer
immediately. He would surely have to dr edge his memory to recall what he was
doing exactly at the same time on e day before. And yet, men often d are claim
to be God, or Kåñëa. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims.
Then again, the Lord explains His prakåti,  or His form. Prakåti  means “nature,”
as well as svarüpa,  or “one’s own form.” The Lord says that He appears in His
own body. He d oes not change His body, as the common living entity changes
from one body to another. The conditione d soul may have one kind of body in
the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material
world, the living entity has no fixed  body but transmigrates from one body to
another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so
in the same original body, by His inte rnal potency. In other words, Kåñëa
appears in this material world in  His original eternal form, with  two hands,
holding a flute. He appears exactly in  His eternal body, uncontaminated by
this material world. Although He appear s in the same transcendental body and
is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary
living en tity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body,
it still appears that Lord Kåñëa grow s from childhood to boyhood and from
boyhood to youth. But astonishingly en ough He never ages beyond youth. At
the time of the Battle of Kurukñetra,  He had many grandchildren at home; or,
in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He
looked just like a young man twenty or  twenty-five years old. We never see a
picture of Kåñëa in old age beca use He never grows old like us,  although He is
the oldest person in the whole creation —past, present, and future. Neither His
body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates  or changes. Therefore, it is clear
that in spite of His being in the material  world, He is the same unborn, eternal
form of bliss and knowledge, changele ss in His transcendental body andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance is like the sun’s
rising, moving before us, and then di sappearing from our eyesight. When the
sun is out of sight, we think that  the sun is set, and when the sun is before our
eyes, we think that the sun is on the hori zon. Actually, the sun is always in its
fixed position, but owing to our defectiv e, insufficient senses, we calculate the
appearance and disappearance of the sun in t he sky. And because Lord Kåñëa’s
appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any
ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful
knowledge by His internal potency—and He is never contaminated by
material na ture. The Vedas  also confirm that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in
multimanifestations. The Vedic supplem entary literatures also confirm that
even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is s till without change
of body. In the Bhägavatam,  He appears before His mother as Näräyaëa, with
four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His
appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon
the living e ntities so that they can concentrat e on the Supreme Lord as He is,
and not on mental concoctions or im aginations, which the impersonalist
wrongly thinks the Lord’s forms to be. The word mäyä,  or ätma-mäyä,  refers to
the Lord’s causeless mercy, according to  the Viçva-koça  dictionary. The Lord is
conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common
living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another
body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He per forms wonderful and
superhuman activities while He is on th is earth. Therefore, the Lord is always
the same Absolute Truth and is withou t differentiation between His form and
self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why
the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next
verse.

PURPORT
The word såjämi  is significant herein. Såjämi  cannot be used in the sense of
creation, because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the
Lord’s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore,
såjämi  means that th e Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord
appears on schedule, namely at th e end of the Dväpara-yuga of the
twenty-eighth millennium of the seventh Manu in one day of Brahmä, He has
no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations, because He is completely
free to act in many ways at His will.  He therefore appears by His own will
whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true
religion. Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas,  and any discrepancy
in th e matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas  makes one
irreligious. In the Bhägavatam  it is stated that such principles are the laws ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the Lord. Only the Lord can manufa cture a system of religion. The Vedas  are
also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahmä, from within
his heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma,  or religion, are the direct orders
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead ( dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam
[SB 6.3.19 ]). These principles are clearly indicated th roughout the
Bhagavad-gétä.  The purpose of the Vedas  is to establish such principles under
the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lo rd directly orders, at the end of the
Gétä,  that the highest principle of religion  is to surrender unto Him only, and
nothin g more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto
Him; and whenever such principles ar e disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord
appears. From the Bhägavatam  we understand that Lord Buddha is the
incarnation of Kåñëa who appeared when materi alism was rampant and
materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas.  Although
there are certain restrictive rules and re gulations regarding animal sacrifice for
particular purposes in the Vedas,  people of demonic tendency still took to
animal sacrifice without reference to  the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha
appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of
nonviolence. Therefore each and every avatära,  or incarnation of the Lord,
has a particular mission, and they ar e all described in the revealed scriptures.
No one should be accepted as an avatära  unless he is referred to by scriptures.
It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest
Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires  to appear. In
each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be
understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But
the mission is the same—to lead people  to God consciousness and obedience to
the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes
He sends His bona fide representative in  the form of His son, or servant, or
Himself in some disguised form.
The principles of the Bhagavad-gétä  were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that
matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced
compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals
four is a mathematical principle  that is true in the beginner’s arithmetic class
and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lowerCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are
taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The
higher principles of religion begin with  the acceptance of the four orders and
the four statuses of social life, as wi ll be explained later. The whole purpose of
the mission of incarnations is to ar ouse Kåñëa consciousness everywhere. Su ch
consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.

According to Bhagavad-gétä,  a sädhu  (holy man) is a man in Kåñëa
consciousness. A person may appear to  be irreligious, but if he has theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.qualifications of Kåñëa consciousness wh olly and fully, he is to be understood
to be a sädhu.  And duñkåtäm  applies to t hose who do not care for Kåñëa
consciousness. Such miscreants, or duñkåtäm,  are described as foolish and the
lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane
education, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in Kåñëa
conscious ness is accepted as a sädhu,  e v e n  t h o u g h  s u c h  a  p e r s o n  m a y  b e
neither learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is
not necessary for the Supreme Lord to a ppear as He is to destroy them, as He
did with the demons Rävaëa and Kaàsa.  The Lord has many agents who are
quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to
appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The
demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his k in.
Although Prahläda Mahäräja was the son of Hiraëyakaçipu, he was
nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devaké, the mother of Kåñëa,
was the sister of Kaàsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only
because Kåñëa was to be born of them.  So Lord Kåñëa appeared primarily to
deliver Devaké, rather than kill Kaàsa, but both were performed
simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and
vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.
In the Caitanya-caritämåta  of Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja, the following verses
(Madhya  20.263–264 ) summarize these principles of incarnation:
såñöi-hetu yei mürti prapaïce avatare
sei éçvara-mürti ‘avatära’ näma dhare
mäyätéta paravyome sabära avasthäna
viçve avatari’ dhare ‘avatära’ näma
“The avatära,  or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of
God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of
Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avatära.  Such
incarnations are situated in the spiritua l world, the kingdom of God. When
they descend to the material creation, they assume the name avatära. ”
There are various kinds of avatäras,  such as puruñävatäras, guëävatäras,
lélävatäras, çakty-äveça avatäras, manvantara-avatäras  and yugävatäras —allCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.appearing on schedule all over the un iverse. But Lord Kåñëa is the primeval
Lord, the fountainhead of all avatäras.  Lord Çré Kåñëa descends for the specific
purpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious
to see Him in His original Våndävana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose
of the Kåñëa avatära  is to satisfy His unalloyed dev otees.
The Lord says that He incarnates  Himself in every millennium. This
indicates that He incarnates also in  the Age of Kali. As stated in the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  the incarnation in the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya
Mahäprabhu, who spread the worship of Kåñëa by the saìkértana  movement
(congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread Kåñëa consciousness
throughout India. He predicted that this culture of saìkértana  would be
broadcast all over the world, from town  to town and village to village. Lord
Caitanya  as the incarnation of Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, is described
secretly but not directly in the confiden tial parts of the revealed scriptures,
such as the Upaniñads, Mahäbhärata  and Bhägavatam.  The devotees of Lord
Kåñëa are very much attracted by the saìkértana  movement of Lord Caitanya.
This avatära  of the Lord does not kill the misc reants, but delivers them by His
causeless mercy.

One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities

PURPORT
The Lord’s descent from His transcen dental abode is already explained in
the 6th verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the
Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and
therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this
present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material
bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the yogés  attain liberation
only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liber ation they
achieve—merging into the impersonal brahmajyoti  of the Lord—is only
partial, and there is the risk of returning to this material world. But the
devotee, simply by understanding the tr anscendental nature of the body and
activities of the Lord, at tains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and
does not run the risk of returning to this material world. In the
Brahma-saàhitä  (5.33) it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and
incarnations: advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam.  Although there are
many transcendental forms of the Lo rd, they are still one and the same
Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with
conviction, although it is incomprehens ible to mundane scholars and empiric
philosophers. As stated in the  Vedas  (Puruña-bodhiné Upaniñad ):
eko devo nitya-lélänurakto
bhakta-vyäpé hådy antar-ätmä
“The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.many transcendental forms in relationsh ips with His unalloyed devotees.” This
Vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the Gétä personally by the Lord. He
who accepts this truth on th e strength of the authority of the Vedas  and of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical
speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by
accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a d oubt, attain liberation. The
Vedic version tat tvam asi  is actually applied in this case. Anyone who
understands Lord Kåñëa to be the Supr eme, or who says unto the Lord “You
are the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead,” is certainly
liberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental
association of the Lord is guaranteed. In  other words, such a faithful devotee of
the Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic
assertion:
tam eva viditväti måtyum eti
nänyaù panthä vidyate ’yanäya
“One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply
by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead, and there is no
other way to achieve this perfection.” ( Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  3.8) That there
is no alternative means that anyone who does not understand Lord Kåñëa as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance and
consequently he will not attain salvatio n simply, so to speak, by licking the
outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting th e Bhagavad-gétä
according to mundane scholarship. Su ch empiric philosophers may assume
very important roles in the material worl d, but they are not necessarily eligible
for liberation. Such puffed-up mundane sc holars have to wait for the causeless
mercy of  the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate Kåñëa
consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection.

As described above, it is very difficu lt for a person who is too materially
affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth.
Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so
absorbed in materialism that it  is almost impossible for them to understand
how the Supreme can be a person. Such materialists cannot even imagine that
there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and
eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of
ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this
same bodily idea in mind when they ar e informed of the personal form of the
Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material
manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be
impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When
they are informed that spiritual life is also i ndividual and personal, they
become afraid of becoming persons again , and so they naturally prefer a kind
of merging into the impersonal void . Generally, they compare the living
entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the
highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual
personality. This is a kind of fearful st age of life, devoid of perfect knowledge
of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot
understand spiritual existence a t all. Being embarrassed by so many theories
and by contradictions of various type s of philosophical speculation, they
become disgusted or angry and foolishl y conclude that there is no supreme
cause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are i n a diseased
condition of life. Some people are too ma terially attached and therefore do not
give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme
spiritual cause, and some of them disbel ieve in everything, being angry at all
sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessn ess. This last class of men take to
the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are
sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of
attachment to th e material world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual
personal identity, and the conception of  void that arises from frustration in
life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has
to take complete shelter of  the Lord, guided by the bo na fide spiritual master,
and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last
stage of the devotional life is called bhäva,  or transcendental love of Godhead.
According to Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.4.15–16 ), the science of devotional
service:
ädau çraddhä tataù sädhu-
saìgo ’tha bhajana-kriyä

“In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization.
This will bring one to the stage of tryi ng to associate with persons who are
spiritually elevated. In the next stag e one becomes initiated by an elevated
spiritual master, and under  his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the
process of devotional service. By exec ution of devotional service under the
guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material
attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquir es a taste for
hearing about the Absolute Personality of  Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. This taste leads
one further forward to attachment for Kåñëa consciousness, which is matured
in bhäva,  or the preliminary stage of transcen dental love of God. Real love for
God is  called prema,  the highest perfectional stage of life.” In the prema  stage
there is constant engagement in the tran scendental loving service of the Lord.
So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona
fide spiritual master, o ne can attain the highest stage, being freed from all
material attachment, from the fearfulness of one’s individual spiritual
personality, and from the frustrations th at result in void philosophy. Then one
can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.

Everyone is searching for Kåñëa in the different aspects of His
manifestations. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially
realized in His impersonal brahmajyoti  effulgence and as the all-pervading
Supersoul dwelling within everything, includi ng the particles of atoms. But
Kåñëa is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, Kåñëa is the
object of everyone’s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied
according to one’s desire to have Hi m. In the transcendental world also , Kåñëa
reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the
devotee wants Him. One devotee may wa nt Kåñëa as supreme master, another
as his personal friend, another as his so n, and still another as his lover. Kåñëa
rewards all t he devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love
for Him. In the material world, the same  reciprocations of feelings are there,
and they are equally exchanged by th e Lord with the different types of
worshipers. The pure devotees both h ere and in the transcendental abode
associate with Him in person and are ab le to render personal service to the
Lord and thus derive transcendental bli ss in His loving service. As for those
who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by
annihilating the individual existence of  the living entity, Kåñëa helps also by
absorbing them into His effulgence. Such  impersonalists do not agree to accept
the eternal, blissful Personality of Go dhead; consequently they cannot relish
the bliss of trans cendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished
their individuality. Some of them, who are not firmly situated even in the
impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormantCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.desires for activities. They are not admitte d into the spiritual planets, but they
are again given a chance to act on th e material planets. For those who are
fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties,
as the yajïeçvara;  and those who are yogés  seeking mystic po wers are awarded
such powers. In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy
alone, and all kinds of spiritual proce sses are but different degrees of success on
the same path. Unless, therefore, one co mes to the highest perfection of Kåñë a
consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the

PURPORT
There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material
world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take
these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the
demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God’s different parts and
parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas  say, nityo
nityänäm:  God is one. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù . The Supreme God is
one—Kåñëa—and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage thi s
material world. These demigods are all living entities ( nityänäm ) with different
grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme
God—Näräyaëa, Viñëu, or Kåñëa. An yone who thinks that God and the
demigods are on the same level is called an a theist, or päñaëòé.  Even the great
demigods like Brahmä and Çiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In
fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahmä and Çiva
(çiva-viriïci-nutam ). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who
are wors hiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of
anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. Iha devatäù  denotes a powerful man or
demigod of this material world. But Näräyaëa, Viñëu, or Kåñëa, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He i s above, or
transcendental to, material creation. Ev en Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya, the leader of
the impersonalists, maintains that Näräya ëa, or Kåñëa, is beyond this material
creation. However, foolish people ( håta-jïäna ) worship the demigods because
they want immediate results. They get the resu lts, but do not know that results
so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. TheCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.intelligent person is in Kåñëa consciousn ess, and he has no need to worship the
paltry demigods for some immedia te, temporary benefit. The demigods of this
material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of
this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary.
Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, includi ng the demigods and
their worshipers, are bubbles in the co s m i c  o c e a n .  I n  t h i s  w o r l d ,  h o w e v e r ,
human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of
possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such
temporary thing s, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human
society. If a man gets some ministersh i p  i n  t h e  g o v e r n m e n t  b y  w o r s h i p i n g  a
political leader, he considers that he ha s achieved a great boon. All of them are
therefore kowtowing to the so-called leader s or “big guns” in order to achieve
temporary boons, and they indeed achi eve such things. Such foolish men are
not interested in Kåñëa consciousness for the permanent solution to the
hardships of material existence. They  are all after sense enjoyment, and to get
a little facility for sense enjoyment th ey are attracted to worship empowered
living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely
interested in Kåñëa consciousness. Th ey are mostly interested in material
enjoyment, and the refore they worship some powerful living entity.

According to the three modes of material nature and the work associated

although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the
nondoer, being unchangeable.
PURPORT
The Lord is the creator of everyt hing. Everything is born of Him,
everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in
Him. He is therefore the creator of th e four divisions of the social order,
beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called brähmaëas  due
to their being situated in the mode of  goodness. Next is the administrative
class, technically called the kñatriyas  due to their being situated in the mode of
passion. The mercantile men, called the vaiçyas,  are sit uated in the mixed
modes of passion and ignorance, and the çüdras,  or laborer class, are situated in
the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four
divisions of human society, Lord Kåñëa does not belong to any of these
divisions, b ecause He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom
form human society. Human society is si milar to any other animal society, but
to elevate men from the animal stat us, the above-mentioned divisions are
created by the Lord for the systematic d evelopment of Kåñëa consciousness.
The tendency of a particular man toward  work is determined by the modes of
material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the
different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth  Chapter of
this book. A person in Kåñëa consci ousness, however, is above even the
brähmaëas.  Although brähmaëas  by quality are supposed to know about
Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth,  most of them approach only the
impersonal Brahman manifestation of L ord Kåñëa. But a man who transcendsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the limited knowledge of a brähmaëa  and reaches the knowledge of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, becomes a person in Kåñëa
consciousness—or, in other words, a Vaiñëava. Kåñëa consciousness includes
knowledge of all different plenary ex pansions of Kåñëa, namely Räma,
Nåsiàha, Varäha, etc. And as Kåñëa is transcendental to this system of the
four divisions of human society, a pe rson in Kåñëa consciousness is also
transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the
divisions of community, nation or species.

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.As there are constitutional laws in th e material world stating that the king
can do no wrong, or that the king is no t subject to the state laws, similarly the
Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the
activities of the  material world. He creates and remains aloof from the
creation, whereas the living entities ar e entangled in the fruitive results of
material activities because of their pr opensity for lording it over material
resources. The proprietor of an establishment  is not responsible for the right
and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves
responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of
sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For
advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work
of this world, and they aspire to he avenly happiness after death. The Lord,
being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The
heavenly demigods ar e only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires
the low-grade happiness such as the work ers may desire. He is aloof from the
material actions and reactions. For exam ple, the rains are not responsible for
different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such
rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic småti  confirms this fact
as follows:
nimitta-mätram eväsau
såjyänäà sarga-karmaëi
pradhäna-käraëé-bhütä
yato vai såjya-çaktayaù
“In the material creations, the Lord  is only the supreme cause. The
immediate cause is material nature, by which the cosmic manifestation is made
visible.” The created beings are of ma ny varieties, such as the demigods,
human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions
of their past good or bad activities . The Lord only gives them the proper
facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He
is never responsible for their past and present activities.  In the Vedänta-sütra
(2.1.34 ) it is confirmed, vaiñamya-nairghåëye na säpekñatvät:  the Lord is never
partial to any living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature , the
external energy. Anyone who is fully conv ersant with all the intricacies of this
law of karma,  or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of
his activities. In other words, the pers on who understands this transcendental
nature of  the Lord is an experienced man in Kåñëa consciousness, and thus he
is never subjected to the laws of karma.  One who does not know the
transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the
Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are th e activities of the ordinary living
entities, certainly becomes entangled hi mself in fruitive reactions. But one
who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in Kåñëa consciousness.

There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material
things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. Kåñëa
consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full
of dirty things can take to t he line of Kåñëa consciousness for a gradual
cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service.
Those who are already cleansed of the im purities may continue to act in the
same Kåñëa consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities
and thereby be benefited. Foolish person s or neophytes in Kåñëa consciousness
often want to retire from activities  without having knowledge of Kåñëa
consciousness. Arjuna’s desire to retire  from activities on the battlefield was
not ap proved by the Lord. One need only kn ow how to act. To retire from the
activities of Kåñëa consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of Kåñëa
consciousness is less important than actua lly engaging in the field of activities
for the sake of Kåñëa. Arjuna is here advised to act in Kåñëa consciousness,
following in the footsteps of the Lord’s previous disciples, such as the sun-god
Vivasvän, as mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past
activities, as well as those of persons who acted in Kå ñëa consciousness in the
past. Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art
from the Lord some millions of years be fore. All such students of Lord Kåñëa
are mentioned here as past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of
duties allotted by Kåñëa.

PURPORT
Action in Kåñëa consciousness has to  be executed in accord with the
examples of previous bona fide devo tees. This is recommended in the 15th
verse. Why such action should not be  independent will be explained in the
text to follow.
To act in Kåñëa consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of
authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the
beginning of this chapter. The system of Kåñëa consciousness was first
narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu
explained it to his son Ikñväku, and th e system is current on this earth from
that very remote time. Therefore, one ha s to follow in the footsteps of previous
authorities in the line of di sciplic succession. Otherwise eve n the most
intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of Kåñëa
consciousness. For this reason, the Lord  decided to instruct Arjuna in Kåñëa
consciousness directly. Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna,
anyone who f ollows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.
It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfectCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid
down by the Lord Himself. Dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam  (Bhäg.
6.3.19 ). No one can manufacture  a religious principle by imperfect speculation.
One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahmä, Çiva,
Närada, Manu, the Kumäras, Kapila, Prahläda, Bhéñma, Çukadeva Gosvämé,
Yamaräja, Janaka, and Bali Mahäräja. By mental speculation one cannot
ascertain what is religion or self-reali zation. Therefore, out of causeless mercy
to His devotees, the Lord explains direct ly to Arjuna what action is and what
inaction is. Only action performed in Kåñëa consciousness can deliver a person
from the e ntanglement of material existence.

understand the distinctions between  action, inaction and unauthorized
actions. One has to apply oneself to such  an analysis of action, reaction and
perverted actions because it is a very difficult subject matter. To understand
Kåñëa consciousness and action according to its modes, one has to learn one’s
relationship with the Supreme; i.e., one who has learned perfectly knows that
every living entity is an eter nal servitor of the Lord and t hat consequently one
has to act in Kåñëa consciousness. The entire Bhagavad-gétä  is directed toward
this conclusion. Any other conclusions,  against this consciousness and its
attendant actions, are vikarmas,  or prohibited actions. To understand all this
one has to associate with authorities in Kåñëa consciousness and learn the
secret from them; this is as good as le arning from the Lord directly. Otherwise,
even the most intelligent persons will be bewildered.

A person acting in Kåñëa consciousne ss is naturally free from the bonds of
karma.  His activities are all performed for Kåñëa; therefore he does not enjoy
or suffer any of the effects of work. Co nsequently he is intelligent in human
society, even though he is engaged in all sorts of activities for Kåñëa. Akarma
means without reaction to work. The impersonalist ceases fruitive activities
out of fear, so that the resultant acti on may not be a stumbling block on the
path of self-realization, but the personalist  knows rightly his position as the
eternal servitor of the Supreme Personal ity of Godhead. Therefore he engages
himself in the activities of Kåñëa consci ousness. Because everything is done for
Kåñëa, he enjoys only transcendental happiness in the discharge  of this
service. Those who are engaged in this process are known to be without desire
for personal sense gratification. The se nse of eternal servitorship to Kåñëa
makes one immune to all sorts of reactionary elements of work.

This freedom from the bondage of actions is possible only in Kåñëa
consciousness, when one is doing ever ything for Kåñëa. A Kåñëa conscious
person acts out of pure love for th e Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
therefore he has no attraction for the resu lts of the action. He is not even
attached to his personal maintenance, for everything is left to Kåñëa. Nor is he
anxious to secure things, nor to prot ect things already in his possession. He
does his duty to the best of his ability and leaves everything to Kåñëa. Such an
unattached person is always free from the resultant reactions of good and bad;
it is as though he were not doin g anything. This is the sign of akarma,  or
actions without fruitive reactions. An y other action, therefore, devoid of
Kåñëa con sciousness, is binding upon the work er, and that is the real aspect of
vikarma,  as explained hereinbefore.

PURPORT
A Kåñëa conscious person does not ex pect good or bad results in his
activities. His mind and intelligence are fully controlled. He knows that
because he is part and parcel of the Supreme, the part played by him, as a part
and parcel of the whole, is not hi s own activity but is only being done through
him by the Supreme. When the hand move s, it does not move out of its own
accord, but by the endeavor of the whole body. A Kåñëa conscious person is
always dovetailed with the supreme desire, for he has no desir e for personal
sense gratification. He moves exactly li ke a part of a machine. As a machine
part requires oiling and cleaning for maintenance, so a Kåñëa conscious man
maintains himself by his work just to remain fit for action in the
transcendental loving  service of the Lord. He is therefore immune to all the
reactions of his endeavors. Like an anim al, he has no proprietorship even over
his own body. A cruel proprietor of an an imal sometimes kills the animal in his
possession, yet the animal does not prote st. Nor does it have any real
independence. A Kåñëa conscious person, fully engaged in self-realization, hasCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.very little time to falsely possess any ma terial object. For maintaining body and
soul, he does not require unfair means of accumulating money. He does not,
therefore, become contaminated by such  material sins. He is free from all
reactions to his actions.

A Kåñëa conscious person does not make much endeavor even to maintain
his body. He is satisfied with gains which are obtained of their own accord. He

satisfied with whatever  is obtained by his own honest labor. He is thereforeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.independent in his livelihood. He does  not allow anyone’s service to hamper
his own service in Kåñëa consciousness. However, for the service of the Lord
he can participate in any kind of action without being disturbed by the duality
of the material world. The duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat
and cold, or misery and happiness. A Kå ñëa conscious person is above duality
because he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfactio n of Kåñëa.
Therefore he is steady both in success and in failure. These signs are visible
when one is fully in transcendental knowledge.

How activities in Kåñëa consciousne ss can lead one ultimately to the
spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in Kåñëa
consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But,
for the present, just the principle of Kåñëa consciousness is described. A
conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the
material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The
process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material  atmosphere
is Kåñëa consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder
of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk
product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured
by Kåñëa consciousness as set forth here in the Gétä.  This process is generally
known as yajïa,  or activities (sacrifices) simp ly meant for the satisfaction of
Viñëu, or Kåñëa. The more the activities of the material world are performed
in Kåñëa consciousness, or f or Viñëu only, the more the atmosphere becomes
spiritualized by complete absorption. The word brahma  (Brahman) means
“spiritual.” The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are
called brahmajyoti,  His spiritual effulgence. Everything th at exists is situated in
that brahmajyoti,  but when the jyoti i s  c o v e r e d  b y  i l l u s i o n  ( mäyä ) or sense
gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by
Kåñëa consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of Kåñëa consciousne ss, the
consuming agent of such an offeri ng or contribution, the process of

together—Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by
mäyä  is called matter. Matter dovetailed for th e cause of the Absolute Truth
regains its spiritual quality. Kåñëa consciousness is the process of converting
the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is
fully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness, it is said to be in samädhi,  or t rance.
Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yajïa,  or
sacrifice for the Absolute. In that cond ition of spiritual consciousness, the
contributor, the contribution, the consumpt ion, the performer or leader of the
performance, and the result or ultimate gain—everything—becomes one inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of Kåñëa
consciousness.

Some yogés perfectly worship the demigods  by offering different sacrifices to
them, and some of them offer sacrifices  in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.
PURPORT
As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in Kåñëa
consciousness is also called a perfect yogé or a first-class mystic. But there are
others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still
others who sacrifice to  the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the
Supreme Lord. So there are different kind s of sacrifices in terms of different
categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of
performers only superficially demark varieties of  sacrifice. Factually sacrificeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Viñëu,  who is also known as Yajïa. All the
different varieties of sacrifice can be  placed within two primary divisions:
namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of
transcendental knowledge. Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness sacrifice all
material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others,
who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material
possessions to satisfy demigods s uch as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who
are impersonalists, sacrifice their iden tity by merging into the existence of
impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by
the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of  all material
functions like the heating, watering an d lighting of the universe. Those who
are interested in material benefits wo rship the demigods by various sacrifices
according to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-éçvara-vädé,  or believers in
many  gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute
Truth and regard the forms of the demi gods as temporary, sacrifice their
individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences
by merging into the existence of t he Supreme. Such impersonalists sacrifice
their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental
nature of the Supreme. In other words,  the fruitive workers sacrifice their
material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the imperson alist
sacrifices his material designations with  a view to merging into the existence
of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, th e fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme
Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman.
The Kåñëa co nscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for
the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and thus a ll his material possessions as well as his
own self—everything—is sacrificed for Kåñëa. Thus, he is the first-class yogé;
but he does not lose his individu al existence.

TRANSLATION
Some [the unadulterated brahmacärés] sacrifice the hearing process and the
senses in the fire of mental control, and others [the regulated householders]
sacrifice the objects of the sens es in the fire of the senses.
PURPORT
The members of the four divisions of human life, namely the brahmacäré,
the gåhastha,  the vänaprastha  and the sannyäsé,  are all meant to become perfect
yogés  or transcendentalists. Since human life is not meant for our enjoying
sense gratification like the  animals, the four orders of human life are so
arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahmacärés,  or
students under the care of a bona fide  spiritual master, control the mind by
abstaining from sense gratification. A brahmacäré  hears only words concerning
Kåñëa consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and
therefore the pure brahmacäré  engages fully in harer
nämänukértanam —chanting and hearing the glorie s of the Lord. He restrains
himself from the vibrations of m aterial sounds, and his hearing is engaged in
the transcendental sound vibration of Ha re Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa. Similarly, the
householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such actsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat- eating are general
tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in
unrestricted sex life and other sense gr atification. Marriage on the principles
of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because th at
is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a
kind of yajïa  because the restricted householder sacrifices his general
tendency toward sense gratification for higher, transcendental life.

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The yoga system conceived by Pataïjali is referred to herein. In the
Yoga-sütra  of Pataïjali, the soul is called pratyag-ätmä  and paräg-ätmä.  As long
as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called paräg-ätmä,  but as soon as
the same soul becomes d etached from such sense enjoyment it is called
pratyag-ätmä.  The soul is subjected to the func tions of ten kinds of air at work
within the body, and this is percei ved through the breathing system. The
Pataïjali system of yoga instructs one on how to contro l the functions of the
body’s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air
within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment.
According to this yoga system, pratyag-ätmä  is the ultimate goal. This
pratyag-ät mä is withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with
the sense objects, like the ear for hearin g, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling,
tongue for tasting, hand for touching , and all of them are thus engaged in
activities outside the self. The y are called the functions of the präëa-väyu.  The
apäna-väyu  goes downwards, vyäna-väyu  acts to shrink and expand,
samäna-väyu  adjusts equilibrium, udäna-väyu  goes upwards—and when one is
enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization .

Having accepted strict vows, some be come enlightened by sacrificing their

PURPORT
These sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons who
are sacrificing their possessions in the fo rm of various kinds of charities. In
India, the rich mercantile community or  princely orders open various kinds of
charitable institutio ns like dharma-çälä, anna-kñetra, atithi-çälä, anäthälaya
and vidyä-péöha.  In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age
homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food,
education and medical treatment free to the poor. Al l these charitable
activities are called dravyamaya-yajïa.  There are others who, for higher
elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe,
voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candräyaëa  and
cäturmäsya.  These proc esses entail severe vows for conducting life under
certain rigid rules. For example, under the cäturmäsya  vow the candidate does
not shave for four months during the ye ar (July to October), he does not eat
certain foods, does not eat twice in a day or does  not leave home. Such
sacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomaya-yajïa.  There are still others
who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas  like the Pataïjali
system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or haöha-yoga  or
añöäìga-yoga  (for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified
places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called yoga-yajïa,  sacrifice for a
certain type of perfection in the mate rial world. There are others who engage
themselves in the  studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the
Upaniñads  and Vedänta-sütras,  or the Säìkhya philosophy. All of these areCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.called svädhyäya-yajïa.  or engagement in the sacrifice of studies. All these
yogés  are faithfully engaged in different types  of sacrifice and are seeking a
higher status of life. Kåñëa consciousness, however, is different from these
because it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord. Kåñëa consciousness
cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifice b ut
can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona fide devotees.
Therefore, Kåñëa consciousness is transcendental.

outgoing breath into itself as a sacrifice.
PURPORT
This system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called
präëäyäma,  and in the beginning it is practiced in the haöha-yoga  system
through different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for
controlling the senses and for advan cement in spiritual realization. This
practice involves controlling the airs wi thin the body so as to reverse the
directions of their passage. The apäna  air goes downward, and the präëa  air
goes up. The präëäyäma-yogé  practices breathing the opposite way u ntil the
currents are neutralized into püraka.  equilibrium. Offering the exhaled breath
into the inhaled breath is called recaka.  When both air currents are completely
stopped, one is said to be in kumbhaka-yoga.  By practice of kumbhaka-yoga.  one
can incre ase the duration of life for perfec tion in spiritual realization. The
intelligent yogé is interested in attaining perfection in one life, without waiting
for the next. For by practicing kumbhaka-yoga.  the yogés  increase the duration
of life by many, many y ears. A Kåñëa conscious person, however, being always
situated in the transcendental lovi ng service of the Lord, automatically
becomes the controller of the senses. Hi s senses, being always engaged in the
service of Kåñëa, have no chance of becoming otherw ise engaged. So at the
end of life, he is naturally transferre d to the transcendental plane of Lord
Kåñëa; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at
once raised to the platform of liberation, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä  (14.26 ):

he is constantly in that conscio usness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and
ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of
reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only kåñëa-prasädam,  or
food which is offered first to the Lord. Reducing the  eating process is very
helpful in the matter of sense control.  And without sense control there is no
possibility of getting out of the material entanglement.

PURPORT
From the foregoing explanation of different types of sacrifice (namely
sacrifice of one’s possessions, study of the Vedas  or philosophical doctrines, and
performance of the yoga system), it is found that  the common aim of all is to
control the senses. Sens e gratification is the root cause of material existence;
therefore, unless and until one is situ ated on a platform apart from sense
gratification, there is no chance of be ing elevated to the eternal platform of
full knowledge, full bliss and full life. Thi s platform is in the eternal
atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices help
one to become cleansed of the sinful re actions of material existence. By this
advancement in life, not only does on e become happy and opulent in this li fe,
but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging
into the impersonal Brahman or assoc iating with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
O best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily onCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.this planet or in this life: what then of the next?
PURPORT
Whatever form of material existence on e is in, one is invariably ignorant of
his real situation. In other words, existe nce in the material world is due to the
multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ig norance is the cause of sinful life, and
sinful life is  the cause of one’s dragging on in material existence. The human
form of life is the only loophole  by which one may get out of this
entanglement. The Vedas,  therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing
out the paths of religion, economic comfort, reg ulated sense gratification and,
at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of
religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically
solves our economic problems. By performance of yajïa  we can have enough
food, enough milk, etc.—even if there is  a so-called increase of population.
When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the
senses. The Vedas  prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense
gratification. There by one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from
material bondage, and the highest perfecti on of liberated life is to associate
with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yajïa
(sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a per son is not inclined to perform
yajïa  according to the Vedas,  how can he expect a happy life even in this body,
and what to speak of another body on another planet? There are different
grades of material comforts in diffe rent heavenly planets, and in all ca ses there
is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yajïa.  But the
highest kind of happiness that a man ca n achieve is to be promoted to the
spiritual planets by practice of Kåñëa consciousness. A life of Kåñëa
consciousness is therefo re the solution to all the problems of material
existence.

PURPORT
The purpose of all sacrifices is to arrive at the status of complete knowledge,
then to gain release from material miseries, and, ultimately, to engage in loving
transcendental service to the Supreme Lord (Kåñëa consciousness).
Nonetheless, there is a myst ery about all these different activities of sacrifice,
and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices sometimes take different forms
according to the particular faith of the performer. When one’s faith reaches
the stage of transcendental knowledge, the perfo rmer of sacrifices should be
considered more advanced than those wh o simply sacrifice material possessions
without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices
remain on the material platform an d bestow no spiritual benefit. Real
knowled ge culminates in Kåñëa consciousness, the highest stage of
transcendental knowledge. Without the el evation of knowledge, sacrifices are
simply material activities. When, howe ver, they are elevated to the level of
transcendental knowledge, all such activiti es enter onto the spiritual platform.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Depending on differences in consciousne ss, sacrificial activities are sometimes
called karma-käëòa  (fruitive activities) and sometimes jïäna-käëòa
(knowledge in the pursuit of truth). It is better when the end is knowl edge.

PURPORT
The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord
therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of
disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual
master without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey
t h e  m e s s a g e  o f  t h e  L o r d  a s  i t  i s  t o  his disciple. No one can be spiritually
realized by manufacturing his own process, as is t he fashion of the foolish
pretenders. The Bhägavatam  (6.3.19 ) says, dharmaà tu säkñäd
bhagavat-praëétam:  the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord.
Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the
right path. Nor by independent study of books of  knowledge can one progress
in spiritual life. One has to approach a bo na fide spiritual master to receive the
knowledge. Such a spiritual master shou ld be accepted in full surrender, and
one should serve the spiritual master l ike a menial servant, without false
prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of
advancement in spiritual life. Inquirie s and submission constitute the proper
combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submiss ion and
service, inquiries from the learned spir itual master will not be effective. One
must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the
genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with
genuine spiritual  understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd
inquiries are condemned. Not only shou ld one hear submissively from the
spiritual master, but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in
submission and service and inquiries. A bona f ide spiritual master is by nature
very kind toward the disciple. Therefor e when the student is submissive and is
always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries
becomes perfect.

personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is
stated in the Bhagavad-gétä,  this impersonal Brahman is the personal
effulgence of Kåñëa. Kåñëa, as the Su preme Personality of Godhead, is the
cause of everything. In the Brahma-saàhitä  it is clearly stated that Kåñëa is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ca use of all causes. Even the millions of
incarn ations are only His different expans ions. Similarly, the living entities
are also expansions of Kåñëa. The Mäyävädé philosophers wrongly think that
Kåñëa loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought
is material in nature. We have e xperience in the material world that a thing,
when fragmentally distributed, lose s its own original identity. But the
Mäyävädé philosophers fail to understand that absolute  means that one plus
one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to on e. This is the
case in the absolute world.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now
covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from Kåñëa.
Although we are separated parts of Kåñëa, we are nevertheless not different
from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is mäyä,  or not actual
fact. We are all meant to satisfy Kåñëa. By mäyä  alone Arjuna thought that the
temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his
eternal spiritual relationship with Kåñëa. The whole tea ching of the Gétä is
targeted toward this end: that a livi ng being, as Kåñëa’s eternal servitor,
cannot be separated from Kåñëa, and his sense of being an identity apart from
Kåñëa is called mäyä.  The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the
Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Ha ving forgotten that purpose since time
immemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods,
etc. Such bodily differences arise fr om forgetfulness of the transcendental
service of the Lord. But w hen one is engaged in transcendental service
through Kåñëa consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion.
One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master
and thereby avoid the delusion  that the living entity i s equal to Kåñëa. Perfect
knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, Kåñëa, is the supreme shelter for all living
entities, and giving up such shelter, th e living entities are deluded by the
material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus,  under
different standards of material identi ty, they become forgetful of Kåñëa.
When, however, such deluded living en tities become situated in Kåñëa
consciousness, it is to be understood th at they are on the path of liberation, as
confirmed in the Bhägava tam (2.10.6 ): muktir hitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa
vyavasthitiù.  Liberation means to be situated in one’s constitutional position as
an eternal servitor of Kåñëa (Kåñëa consciousness).

PURPORT
Proper understanding of one’s constitu tional position in relationship to
Kåñëa is so nice that it can at once lift one from the struggle for existence
which goes on in the ocean of nescienc e. This material world is sometimes
regarded as an ocean of nescien ce and sometimes as a blazing forest. In the
ocean, however expert a swimmer one ma y be, the struggle for existence is very
severe. If someone comes forward and lifts the struggling swimmer from the
ocean, he is the greatest savior. Perfect knowledge, rece ived from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is the path  of liberation. The boat of Kåñëa
consciousness is very simple, but at the same time the most sublime.

Perfect knowledge of self and Supe rself and of their relationship is

activities, but also all reactions to pi ous activities, turning them to ashes.
There are many stages of react ion: reaction in the making, reaction
fructifying, reaction already achieved, and reaction a priori.  But knowledge of
the constitutional position of the livi ng entity burns everything to ashes.
When one is in complete knowledge, all reactions, both a prior i and a
posteriori,  are consumed. In the Vedas  (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad  4.4.22 ) it is
stated, ubhe uhaivaiña ete taraty amåtaù sädhv-asädhüné:  “One overcomes both
the pious and impious reactions of work.”

PURPORT
When we speak of transcendental knowle dge, we do so in terms of spiritual
understanding. As such, there is  nothing so sublime and pure as
transcendental knowledge. Ignorance is the cause of our bondage, and
knowledge is the cause of our liberation. This kn owledge is the mature fruit of
devotional service, and when one is si tuated in transcendental knowledge, he
need not search for peace elsewhere, fo r he enjoys peace within himself. In
other words, this knowledge and peace culminate in Kåñëa consciousness. That
is the last word in the Bhagavad-gétä.

Such knowledge in Kåñëa consciousness can be achieved by a faithful
person who believes firmly in Kåñëa. One is called a faithful man who thinks
that simply by acting in Kåñëa cons ciousness he can attain the highest
perfection. This faith is attained by th e discharge of devotional service, and by
chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare
Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, which cleanses one’s heart of all material dirt.

PURPORT
Out of many standard and author itative revealed scriptures, the
Bhagavad-gétä  is the best. Persons who are almost like animals have no faith in,
or knowledge of, the standard revealed scriptures; and some, even though they
have knowledge of, or can cite pa ssages from, the revealed scriptures, have
actually no faith in these words. And even though others may have faith in
scriptures like Bhagavad-gétä,  they do not believe in or worship the Personality
of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. Such persons cannot have any stand ing in Kåñëa
consciousness. They fall down. Out of all the above-mentioned persons, those
who have no faith and are always doub t f u l  m a k e  n o  p r o g r e s s  a t  a l l .  M e nCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.without faith in God and His revealed word  find no good in this world, nor in
the next. For the m there is no happiness whatsoever. One should therefore
follow the principles of revealed scriptur es with faith and thereby be raised to
the platform of knowledge. Only this knowledge will help one become
promoted to the transcendental platform of spiritu al understanding. In other
words, doubtful persons have no status whatsoever in spiritual emancipation.
One should therefore follow in the footsteps of great äcäryas  who are in the
disciplic succession and thereby attain success.

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The yoga system instructed in this chapter is called sanätana-yoga,  or
eternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of
sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one’s material possessions, and the
other is called kno wledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of
one’s material possessions is not dovetail ed for spiritual realization, then such
sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a
spiritual objective, or in devotiona l service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we
come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two:
namely, understanding of one’s own self (or one’s constitutional position), and
the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead . One who follows the
path of Bhagavad-gétä  as it is can very easily understand these two important
divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining
perfect knowledge of the self as pa rt and parcel of the Lord. And such
underst anding is beneficial, for such a person can easily understand the
transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the
transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord
Himself. One who does not understand the  instructions of the Gétä is faithless,
and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded
to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand
the real nature of the Lord as  the eternal, blissful, all-know ing Personality of
Godhead is certainly fool number one.  Ignorance can be removed by gradual
acceptance of the principles of Kåñë a consciousness. Kåñëa consciousness is
awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to
Brahman, sacrif ice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in
practicing mystic yoga,  in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in
studying the Vedas,  and in partaking of the social institution called
varëäçrama-dharma.  All of these are known as sa crifice, and all of them are
based on regulated action. But within a ll these activities, the important factor
is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of
Bhagavad-gétä,  but one who doubts the author ity of Kåñëa falls back. One is
therefore advised to study Bhagavad-gétä,  or any other scripture, under a bona
fide spiritual master, with service and su rrender. A bona fide spiritual master is
in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at allCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.from the inst ructions of the Supreme Lord as  they were imparted millions of
years ago to the sun-god, from  whom the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä  have
come down to the earthly kingdom. On e should, therefore, follow the path of
Bhagavad-gétä  as it is expressed in the Gétä itself and beware of self-interested
people after personal aggrandizement wh o deviate others from the actual path.
The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are
transcendental. One who understands th is is a liberated person from the very
beginning of his study of Bhagavad-gétä.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourth Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Transcendental Knowledge.

Arjuna said: O Kåñëa, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and then
again You recommend work with devotion. Now will You kindly tell me
definitely which of the two is more beneficial?
PURPORT
In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä,  t h e  L o r d  s a y s  t h a t  w o r k  i n
devotional service is better than dry me ntal speculation. Devotional service is
easier than the latter because, being tr anscendental in nature, it frees one
from reaction. In the Second  Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and
its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this
material encagement by buddhi-yoga,  or devotional service, was also explained
therein. In the Third Chap ter, it was explained that a person who is situated
on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And in the
Fourth Chapter the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work
culminate in knowledge. However, at th e end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord
advised  Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge.
Therefore, by simultaneously stressi ng the importance of both work in
devotion and inaction in knowledg e, Kåñëa has perplexed Arjuna and
confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in
knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities.
But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In
other words, he thinks that sannyäsa,  or renunciation in knowledge, should beCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.altogether free from all kinds of acti vity, because work and renunciation
appear to him to be incompatible. He  appears not to have understood that
work in full knowledge is nonreactive an d is therefore the same as inaction.
He inquires, therefore, whether he s hould cease work altogether or work with
full knowledge.

The Personality of Godhead replied: The renunciation of work and work in

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material
bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the
standard of bodily comfort, one is sure  to transmigrate to different types of
bodies, thereby continuing materi al bondage perpetually. Çrémad-Bhägavatam
(5.5.4–6 ) confirms this as follows:
nünaà pramattaù kurute vikarma
yad indriya-prétaya äpåëoti
na sädhu manye yata ätmano ’yam
asann api kleça-da äsa dehaù
paräbhavas tävad abodha-jäto

yävat kriyäs tävad idaà mano vai
karmätmakaà yena çaréra-bandhaù
evaà manaù karma-vaçaà prayuìkte
avidyayätmany upadhéyamäne
prétir na yävan mayi väsudeve
na mucyate deha-yogena tävat
“People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this
present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one’s fruitive activities in
the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in
many ways. Therefor e, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is
considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about his real
identity. As long as he does not know his real identity, he has to work for
fruitive results for sense gratification, and  as long as one is engrossed in the
consciousness of sense gratification one has to transmigrate from one body to
another. Although the mind may be en grossed in fruitive activities and
influenced by ignorance, one must de velop a love for devotional service  to
Väsudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage
of material existence.”
Therefore, jïäna  (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit
soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in Kåñëa
consciousness is not, howe ver, action on the fruitive platform. Activities
performed in full knowledge strengthen one’s advancement in real knowledge.
Without Kåñëa consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not
actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not
purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in Kåñëa
consciousness automatically helps one esca pe the result of fruitive action so
that one need not descend to the mater ial platform. Therefore action in Kåñëa
consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of
falling. Renunciation without Kåñëa consciousness is incomplete, as is
confirmed by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.2.258 ):
präpaïcikatayä buddhyä
hari-sambandhi-vastunaù
mumukñubhiù parityägo
vairägyaà phalgu kathyate
“When persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking them to be material, their
renunciation is called incomplete.” Renunc iation is complete when it is in the
knowledge that everything in existen ce belongs to the Lord and that no one
should claim proprietorship over an ything. One should understand that,
factually, nothing belongs to anyone . Then where is the question of
renunciation? One who knows that everyt hing is Kåñëa’s property is always
situated in renunciation. Since everything  belongs to Kåñëa, everything should
be employed in the service of Kåñëa. This perfect form of action in Kåñëa
consciousness is far better than any am ount of artificial renunciation by a
sannyäsé  of the Mäyävädé school .

One who is fully in Kåñëa consciousness is always a renouncer because he
feels neither hatred nor desire for the re sults of his actions. Such a renouncer,
dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is fully qualified in
knowledge because h e knows his constitutional position in his relationship
with Kåñëa. He knows fully well that Kåñëa is the whole and that he is part and
parcel of Kåñëa. Such knowledge is pe rfect because it is qualitatively and
quantitatively correct. The concept of onenes s with Kåñëa is incorrect because
the part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality
yet different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to
become full in himself, having nothing to aspire to or lament over. T here is no
duality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for Kåñëa. Being thus
freed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated—even in this material

actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths
achieves the results of both.
PURPORT
The aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of
existence. The soul of the material world is Viñëu, or the Supersoul.
Devotional service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One process is
to find the root of the tree,  and the other is to water the root. The real student
of Säìkhya philosophy finds the root of the material world, Viñëu, and then,
in perfect knowledge, engages himself in  the service of the Lord. Therefore, inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.essence, there is no difference between the t wo because the aim of both is
Viñëu. Those who do not know the ul timate end say that the purposes of
Säìkhya and karma-yoga  are not the same, but one who is learned knows the
unifying aim in these different processes.

One who knows that the position reached by means of analytical study can

and devotional service to be on the sa me level, sees things as they are.
PURPORT
The real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of
life. Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference
between the conclusions reached by the two processes. By SäìkhyaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.philosophical research one comes t o the conclusion that a living entity is not a
part and parcel of the material world but of the supreme spirit whole.
Consequently, the spirit soul has nothin g to do with the material world; his
actions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he ac ts in Kåñëa
consciousness, he is actually in his cons titutional position. In the first process,
Säìkhya, one has to become detached  from matter, and in the devotional yoga
process one has to attach himself to the work of Kåñëa consciousness.
Factually, bot h processes are the same, although superficially one process
appears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve
attachment. Detachment from matter an d attachment to Kåñëa are one and
the same. One who can see this sees things as they ar e.

Merely renouncing all activities yet not engaging in the devotional service of

PURPORT
There are two classes of sannyäsés,  or persons in the renounced order of life.
The Mäyävädé sannyäsés  are engaged in the study of Säìkhya philosophy,
whereas the Vaiñëava sannyäsés  are engaged in the study of Bhägavatam
philosophy, which affords the proper  commentary on the Vedänta-sütras.  The
Mäyävädé sannyäsés  also study the Vedänta-sütras,  but use their own
commentary, called Çäréraka-bhäñya,  written by Çaìkaräcärya. The students of
the Bhägavata  school are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord,
according to päïcarätriké  regulations, and therefore the Vaiñëava sannyäsés
have multiple engagements in the tran scendental service of the Lord. The
Vaiñëava sannyäsés  have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they
perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the
Mäyävädé sannyäsés,  engaged in the studies of Säìkhya and Vedänta and
speculation, cannot relish the transcen dental service of the Lord. Because
their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of  Brahman
speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bhägavatam  without proper
understanding. Consequently their study of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  becomes
troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial
means are all useless for the Mäyävädé sannyäsés.  The Vaiñëava sannyäsés,  who
are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their
transcendental duties, and they have th e guarantee of ultimate entrance into
the kingdom of God. The Mäyävädé sannyäsés  sometimes fal l down from the
path of self-realization and again en ter into material activities of a
philanthropic and altruistic natu re, which are nothing but material
engagements. Therefore, the conclusi on is that those who are engaged in
Kåñëa conscious activities ar e better situated than the sannyäsés  engaged in
simple speculation about what is Brah man and what is not Brahman, although
they too come to Kåñëa consciousness, after many births.

One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his mind

PURPORT
One who is on the path of liberation by Kåñëa consciousness is very dear to
every living being, and every living bein g is dear to him. This is due to his
Kåñëa consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as
separate from Kåñëa, just as th e leaves and branches of a tree are not separate
from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the
tree, the water will be distributed to  all the leaves and branches, or by
supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically  distributed
throughout the body. Because one who works in Kåñëa consciousness is servant
t o  a l l ,  h e  i s  v e r y  d e a r  t o  e v e r y o n e .  And because everyone is satisfied by his
work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, hisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.mind is comp letely controlled. And because his mind is controlled, his senses
are also controlled. Because his mind is  always fixed on Kåñëa, there is no
chance of his being deviated from Kåñë a. Nor is there a chance that he will
engage his senses in matters other tha n the service of the Lord. He does not
like to hear anything except topics relating to Kåñëa; he does not like to eat
anything which is not offered to Kåñëa; and he does not wish to go anywhere if
Kåñëa is not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled . A man of
controlled senses cannot be offensive to  anyone. One may ask, “Why then was
Arjuna offensive (in battle) to others ? Wasn’t he in Kåñëa consciousness?”
Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained
in the Second C hapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would
continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one
was killed on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. Only their dresses were changed by
the order of Kåñëa, who was perso nally present. Therefore Arjuna, while
fighting on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, was not really fighting at all; he was
simply carrying out the orders of Kåñëa in full Kåñëa consciousness. Such a
person is never entangled in the reactions of work.

TRANSLATION
A person in the divine consciousness,  although engaged in seeing, hearing,
touching, smelling, eating, moving about, sleeping and breathing, always knows
within himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because while speaking,
evacuating, receiving, or  opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only
the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from
them.
PURPORT
A person in Kåñëa consciousness is pu re in his existence, and consequently
he has nothing to do with any work which depends upon five immediate and
remote causes: the doer, the work, the situation, the endeavor and fortune.
This is because he is engaged in  the loving transcendental service of Kåñëa.
Although he appears to be acting with his body and senses, he is always
conscious of his actual position, which is spiritual engagement. In material
consciousness, the senses are engaged in sense gratification, but in Kåñëa
consciousness the senses are engaged in the satisfaction of Kåñëa’s senses.
Therefore, the Kåñëa conscious person is  always free, even though he appears
to be engaged in affairs of the senses. Activities such as seeing and hearing areCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.actions of the senses meant for receiving knowledge, whereas moving,
speaking, evacuating, etc., are actions of the senses meant for work. A Kåñëa
conscious person is never affected by  the actions of the senses. He cannot
perform any act except in the service of t he Lord because he knows that he is
the eternal servitor of the Lord.

PURPORT
Here brahmaëi  means in Kåñëa consciousness. The material world is a sum
total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically calledCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the pradhäna.  The Vedic hymns sarvaà hy etad brahma  (Mäëòükya Upaniñad
2), tasmäd etad brahma näma-rüpam a nnaà ca jäyate  (Muëòaka Upaniñad
1.2.10 ), and, in the Bhagavad-gétä  (14.3), mama yonir mahad brahma  indicate
that everything in the material world is a manifestation of Brahman; and
although the effects are differently ma nifested, they are nondifferent fro m the
cause. In the Éçopaniñad  it is said that everything is related to the Supreme
Brahman, or Kåñëa, and thus everythi ng belongs to Him only. One who knows
perfectly well that everything belongs to  Kåñëa, that He is the proprietor of
everything and that,  therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the
Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether
virtuous or sinful. Even one’s material body, being a gift of the Lord for
carrying out a particular type of action, can b e engaged in Kåñëa
consciousness. It is then beyond contam ination by sinful reactions, exactly as
the lotus leaf, though remaining in the wa ter, is not wet. The Lord also says in
the Gétä (3.30), mayi sarväëi karmäëi sannyasya:  “Resign all works unto Me
[Kåñëa].” The conclusion is that a pe rson without Kåñëa consciousness acts
according to the concept of the mater ial body and senses, but a person in
Kåñëa consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the
property of Kåñëa and should therefo re be engaged in the service of Kåñëa.

The yogés, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence and

PURPORT
When one acts in Kåñëa consciousness for the satisfaction of the senses of
Kåñëa, any action, whether of the body, mind, intelligence or even the senses,
is purified of material contaminatio n. There are no material reactions
resulting from the activities o f a Kåñëa conscious person. Therefore purified
activities, which are generally called sad-äcära,  can be easily performed by
acting in Kåñëa consciousness. Çré Rüpa Gosvämé in his
Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.2.187 ) describes this as follows:
éhä yasya harer däsye
karmaëä manasä girä
nikhiläsv apy avasthäsu
jévan-muktaù sa ucyate
“A person acting in Kåñëa consciousne ss (or, in other words, in the service
of Kåñëa) with his body, mind, intelli gence and words is a liberated person
even within the material world, although  he may be engaged in many so-called
material activities.” He ha s no false ego, for he does not believe that he is this
material body, or that he possesses the bo dy. He knows that he is not this body
and that this body does not belong to him. He himself belongs to Kåñëa, and
the body too belongs to Kåñëa. When he appli es everything produced of the
body, mind, intelligence, words, life, wealth, etc.—whatever he may have
within his possession—to Kåñëa’s service, he is at once dovetailed with Kåñëa.
He is one with Kåñëa and is devoid of  the false ego that leads one to beli eveCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.that he is the body, etc. This is the perfect stage of Kåñëa consciousness.

The steadily devoted soul attains unad ulterated peace because he offers the

PURPORT
The difference between a person in Kåñëa consciousness and a person in
bodily consciousness is that the former is attached to Kåñëa whereas the latter
is attached to the results of his activiti es. The person who is attached to Kåñëa
and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he has no anxiety
over the results of his work. In the Bhägavatam,  the cause of anxiety over the
result of an activity is explained as being one’s functioning in the conceptionCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.of duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Kåñëa is the
Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In Kåñëa consciousness,
there is no duality. All that exists is  a product of Kåñëa’s energy, and Kåñëa is
all good. Therefore, activities in Kåñëa consciousness are on the  absolute
plane; they are transcendental and have no material effect. One is therefore
filled with peace in Kåñëa consciousness. But one who is entangled in profit
calculation for sense gratification cannot ha ve that peace. This is the secret of
Kåñëa cons ciousness—realization that there is no existence besides Kåñëa is
the platform of peace and fearlessness.

all actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body],
neither working nor causing work to be done.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT
The embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the body,
or the figurative city of body, are co nducted automatically by its particular
modes of nature. The soul, although subjec ting himself to the conditions of the
body, can be beyond  those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to
forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and
therefore suffers. By Kåñëa consciousness,  he can revive his real position and
thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, wh en one takes to Kåñëa
consciousness, one at once becomes comp letely aloof from bodily activities. In
such a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily
within the city of nine gates. The nine gates are mentioned as follows:
nava-dväre pure dehé
haàso leläyate bahiù
vaçé sarvasya lokasya

“The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within the body of a
living entity, is the controller of all li ving entities all over the universe. The
body consists of nine gates [two eyes , two nostrils, two ears, one mouth, the
anus and the genitals].  The living entity in his conditioned stage identifies
himself with the body, but when he id entifies himself with the Lord within
himself, he becomes just as free as  the Lord, even while in the body.”
(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  3.18)
Therefore, a Kåñëa conscious person is  free from both the outer and inner
activities of the material body.

The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities,

is enacted by the modes of material nature.
PURPORT
The living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one of the
energies or natures of the Supreme Lord  but is distinct from matter, which is
another nature—called inferior—of the Lord. Somehow the superior nature,
the living entity, has been  in contact with material nature since time
immemorial. The temporary body or mate rial dwelling place which he obtains
is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions. Living in
such a conditional atmosphere, one suffers the results o f the activities of the
body by identifying himself (in ignora nce) with the body. It is ignorance
acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and
distress. As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the
body, he becomes free from the reactions as we ll. As long as he is in the city of
body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor
nor controller of its actions and reaction s .  H e  i s  s i m p l y  i n  t h e  m i d s t  o f  t h eCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.material ocean, str uggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing

TRANSLATION
Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone’s sinful or pious activities.
Embodied beings, however, are bewild ered because of the ignorance which
covers their real knowledge.
PURPORT
The Sanskrit word vibhu  means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited
knowledge, riches, strength, fame, be auty and renunciation. He is always
satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not
create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and
thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior
nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by
ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living
entity is not. The Lord is vibhu,  or omniscient, but the living entity is aëu, or
atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will.
Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living
entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires,
but the Lord is never responsible for th e actions and reactions of the particular
situati on which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the
embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and
becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is
the constant companion of the l iving entity as Paramätmä, or the Supersoul,
and therefore He can understand the desi res of the individual soul, as one can
smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of
conditioning for the living en tity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves:
Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent
in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, howe ver, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord,
being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the mi nute
independent living entities. However, wh en one desires Kåñëa, the Lord takes
special care and encourages one to desire  in such a way that one can attain to
Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare, eña u hy eva
sädhu karma kärayat i taà yam ebhyo lokebhya unninéñate.  eña u eväsädhu karma
kärayati yam adho ninéñate:  “The Lord engages the living entity in pious
activities so that he may be elevat ed. The Lord engages him in impious
activities so that he may go to hell.” ( Kauñétaké Upan iñad 3.8)
ajïo jantur anéço ’yam

“The living entity is completely de pendent in his distress and happiness. By
the will of the Supreme he can go to heaven  or hell, as a cloud is driven by theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.air.”
Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid Kåñëa
consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is
constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his
existence he forgets his constituti onal position of service to the Lord and is
thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living
entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The
Vedänta-sütras  (2.1.34 ) also confirm this. Vaiñamya-nairghå ëye na säpekñatvät
tathä hi darçayati:  “The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He
appears to.”

When, however, one is enlightened with the knowledge by which nescience
is destroyed, then his knowledge reveals everything, as the sun lights up
everything in the daytime.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT
Those who have forgotten Kåñëa must certainly be bewildered, but those
who are in Kåñëa consciousness are not bewi ldered at all. It is stated in the
Bhagavad-gétä,  sarvaà jïäna-plavena,  jïänägniù sarva-karmäëi  and na hi
jïänena sadåçam.  Knowledge is always  highly esteemed. And what is that
knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achiev ed when one surrenders unto Kåñëa, as
is said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse : bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän
mäà prapadyate.  After passing through many, many births, when one perf ect
in knowledge surrenders unto Kåñëa, or when one attains Kåñëa consciousness,
then everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the
daytime. The living entity is bewilder ed in so many ways. For instance, when
he unceremoniously  thinks himself God, he actua lly falls into the last snare of
nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by
nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience,
or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledg e can be obtained from a person
who is in perfect Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a
bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what Kåñëa consciousness is,
for Kåñëa consciousness will certainly  drive away all nescience, as t he sun
drives away darkness. Even though a pe rson may be in full knowledge that he
is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to
discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know
everything well if he c ares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide Kåñëa
conscious spiritual master. One can kn ow God and one’s relationship with
God only when one actually meets a re presentative of God. A representative
of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid  all the respect
ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the
distinction between God and the living entity. Lord Çré Kåñëa therefore stated
in the Second Chapter ( 2.12) that every living being is individual and that the
Lord also is individual. They were a ll individuals in the past, they are
individuals at present, and they will cont inue to be individuals in the future,
even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in
day, when the sun is up, we see everything in its re al identity. Identity withCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge.

When one’s intelligence, mind, faith an d refuge are all fixed in the Supreme,

PURPORT
The Supreme Transcendental Truth is Lord Kåñëa. The whole
Bhagavad-gétä  centers around the declaratio n that Kåñëa is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. That is the version of all Vedic literature. Para-tattva
means the Supreme Reality, who is understood b y the knowers of the Supreme
as Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän. Bhagavän, or the Supreme PersonalityCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.of Godhead, is the last word in the Ab solute. There is nothing more than that.
The Lord says, mattaù parataraà nänyat kiïcid asti dhanaïjaya . Impersonal
Brahman is also supported by Kåñëa: brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham . Therefore in
all ways Kåñëa is the Supreme Reality. One whose mind, intelligence, faith and
refuge are always in Kåñëa, or, in ot her words, one who is fully in Kåñëa
consciousness, is undoubtedly  washed clean of all misgivings and is in perfect
knowledge in everything concerning tr anscendence. A Kåñëa conscious person
can thoroughly understand that there is duality (simultaneous identity and
individuality) in Kåñëa, and, equipped with such transce ndental knowledge,
one can make steady progress on the path of liberation.

learned and gentle brähmaëa, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater
[outcaste].Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT
A Kåñëa conscious person does not make any distinction between species or
castes. The brähmaëa  and the outcaste may be different from the social point
of view, or a dog, a cow, and an elep hant may be different from the point of
view of species, but these d ifferences of body are meaningless from the
viewpoint of a learned transcendentalist.  This is due to their relationship to
the Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Paramätmä, is
present in everyone’s heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real
knowledge. As far as the bodies are co ncerned in different castes or different
species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every
living being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Paramätmä regardless of the
circu mstances of the living entities. The Lord as Paramätmä is present both in
the outcaste and in the brähmaëa,  although the body of a brähmaëa  and that
of an outcaste are not the same. Th e bodies are material productions of
different modes of material nature,  but the soul and the Supersoul within the
body are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul
and the Supersoul, however, does not ma ke them equal in quantity, for the
individual soul is present only in that particular body w hereas the Paramätmä
is present in each and every body . A Kåñëa conscious person has full
knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The
similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both
conscious, ete rnal and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is
conscious within the limited jurisdiction  of the body whereas the Supersoul is
conscious of all bodies. The Supersou l is present in all bodies without
distinction.

Equanimity of mind, as mentioned above, is the sign of self-realization.
Those who have actually attained to such a stage should be considered to have
conquered material conditions, specifically birth and death. As long as one
identifies with this body, he  is considered a conditioned soul, but as soon as he
is elevated to the stage of equanimity through realization of self, he is liberated
from conditional life. In other words, he  is no longer subject to take birth in
the material world but can enter into t he spiritual sky after his death. The
Lord is flawless because He is without a ttraction or hatred. Similarly, when a
living entity is without attraction or  hatred, he also becomes flawless and
eligible to enter into the spirit ual sky. Such persons are to b e considered
already liberated, and their symptoms are described below.

PURPORT
The symptoms of the self-realized person are given herein. The first
symptom is that he is not illusioned by the false identification of the body with
his true self. He knows perfectly well that he is not this body, but is the
fragmental portion of the Sup reme Personality of Godhead. He is therefore
not joyful in achieving something, nor does he lament in losing anything
which is related to his body. Th is steadiness of mind is called sthira-buddhi,  or
self-intelligence. He is therefore never bewildered by m istaking the gross body
for the soul, nor does he accept the body as permanent and disregard theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.existence of the soul. This knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing
the complete science of the Absolute Truth, namely Brahman, Paramätmä and
Bhagavän . He thus knows his constitutional position perfectly well, without
falsely trying to become one with the Supreme in all respects. This is called
Brahman realization, or self-realization . Such steady consciousness is called
Kåñëa consciousness.

Kåñëa consciousness, is so ab sorbed in the loving service of the Lord that he
loses his taste for material sense pleasu re altogether. The highest pleasure in
terms of matter is sex pleasure. The whole world is moving under its spell, and
a materialist cannot work at all without this m otivation. But a person engaged
in Kåñëa consciousness can work with greater vigor without sex pleasure,
which he avoids. That is the test in sp iritual realization. Spiritual realization
and sex pleasure go ill together. A Kåñëa conscious person is not att racted to
any kind of sense pleasure, due to his being a liberated soul.

An intelligent person does not take part  in the sources of misery, which are
due to contact with the material senses. O son of Kunté, such pleasures have a
beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.
PURPORT
Material sense pleasures are due to the contact of the material senses, which
are all temporary because the body itself is temporary. A liberated soul is not
interested in anything which is temporary. Knowing well the joys of
transcendental pleasures, how can a liberated soul agree to enjoy false
pleasure? In the Padma Puräëa  it is said:
ramante yogino ’nante
satyänande cid-ätmani
iti räma-padenäsau
paraà brahmäbhidhéyate
“The mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute
Truth, and therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of
Godhead, is also known as Räma.”
In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also ( 5.5.1) it is said:
näyaà deho deha-bhäjäà nå-loke
kañöän kämän arhate viò-bhujäà ye
tapo divyaà putrakä yena sattvaà

“My dear sons, there is no reason to labor very hard for sense pleasure while
in this human form of life; such pleasures are available to the stool-eaters
[hogs]. Rather, you should undergo pe nances in this life by which your
existence will be purified, an d as a result you will be able to enjoy unlimited
transcendental bliss.”
Therefore, those who are true yogés  or learned transcendentalists are notCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.attracted by sense pleasures, which are the causes of continuous material
existence. The more one is addicted to material pleasures, the more he is

Only a person who is fully in Kåñëa co nsciousness can be said to be engagedCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.in welfare work for all living entities. When a person is actually in the
knowledge that Kåñëa is the fountainhead  of everything, then when he acts in
that spirit he acts for every one. The sufferings of humanity are due to
forgetfulness of Kåñëa as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor, and the
supreme friend. Therefore, to act to revi ve this consciousness within the entire
human society is the highest welfare work. One cannot  be engaged in such
first-class welfare work without being liberated in the Supreme. A Kåñëa
conscious person has no doubt about the supremacy of Kåñëa. He has no doubt
because he is completely freed from all sins. This is the state of divine love.
A person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human
society cannot factually help anyone. Te mporary relief of the external body
and the mind is not satisfactory. The real cause of one’s difficulties in the hard
struggle for life may be fo und in one’s forgetfulness of his relationship with the
Supreme Lord. When a man is fully cons cious of his relationship with Kåñëa,
he is actually a liberated soul, although he may be in the material tabernacle.

Those who are free from anger and all ma terial desires, who are self-realized,

liberation in the Supreme in the very near future.
PURPORT
Of the saintly persons who are constantly engaged in striving toward
salvation, one who is in Kåñëa cons ciousness is the best of all. The Bhägavatam
(4.22.39 ) confirms this fact as follows:
yat-päda-paìkaja-paläça-viläsa-bhaktyä
karmäçayaà grathitam udgrathayanti santaù
tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo ’pi ruddha-
sroto-gaëäs tam araëaà bhaja väsudevam
“Just try to worship, in devotion al service, Väsudeva, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Even great sage s are not able to control the forces of
the senses as effectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by
serving the lotus feet of the Lo rd, uprooting the deep-grown desire for fruitive
activities.”
In the conditioned soul the desire to en joy the fruitive results of work is so
d e e p  r o o t e d  t h a t  i t  i s  v e r y  d i f f i c u l t  even for the great sages to control such
desires, despite great endeavors. A devo tee of the Lord, constantly engaged in
devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very
quickly attains liberation in the Suprem e. Owing to his complete knowledge in
self-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analogous example of
this:
darçana-dhyäna-saàsparçair
matsya-kürma-vihaìgamäù
sväny apatyäni puñëanti
tathäham api padma-jaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.“By vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the
birds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!”
The fish brings up its offspring simp ly by looking at them. The tortoise
brings up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid
on land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly,
the devotee in Kåñëa con sciousness, although far away from the Lord’s abode,
can elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly—by
engagement in Kåñëa consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material
miseries; this state of life is called brahma-nirväëa,  or the absence of material
miseries due to being constantly immersed in the Supreme.

TRANSLATION
Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision
concentrated between the two eyebrows , suspending the inward and outward
breaths within the nostrils, and thus controlling the mind, senses and
intelligence, the transcendentalist aiming at liberation becomes free from desire,
fear and anger. One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.
PURPORT
Being engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, one can immediately understand
one’s spiritual identity, and then on e can understand the Supreme Lord by
means of devotional service. When one is well situated in devotional service,
one comes to the transcendental pos ition, qualified to feel the presence of the
Lord in the sphere of one’s activity. This  particular position is called liberation
in the Supreme.
After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the
Lord gives instruction to Arjuna as to  how one can come to that position by
the practice of the mysticism or yoga known as añöäìga-yoga,  which is divisible
into an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma,
pratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna  and samädhi.  In the Sixth Chapter the subject of
yoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily
explained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form,
taste and smell by the pratyähära  process in yoga,  and then keep the vision of
the eyes between the two eyebrows an d concentrate on the tip of the nose
with half-closed lids. There is no benefi t in closing the eyes altogether, because
then there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense
objects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by
neutralizing the up-moving a nd down-moving air within the body. By practice
of such yoga one is able to gain control over  the senses, refrain from outward
sense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.
This yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger
and thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In
other words, Kåñëa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga
principles. This will be thor oughly explained in the next chapter. A Kåñëa
conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does
not risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of
controlling the senses than by the añöäìga-yoga.

A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimateCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.beneficiary of all sacrifices and austeritie s, the Supreme Lord of all planets and
demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace
from the pangs of mate rial miseries.
PURPORT
The conditioned souls within the clutches  of illusory energy are all anxious
to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for
peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gétä.  The greatest peace
formula is simply this:  Lord Kåñëa is the beneficiary in all human activities.
Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because
He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater
than He. He is greater than the greatest o f the demigods, Lord Çiva and Lord
Brahmä. In the Vedas  (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  6.7) the Supreme Lord is
described as tam éçvaräëäà paramaà maheçvaraà.  Under the spell of illusion,
living entities are trying to be lord s of all they survey, but actually they  are
dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of
material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of
material nature. Unless one understands th ese bare facts, it is not possible to
achieve peace in the wo rld either individually or collectively. This is the sense
of Kåñëa consciousness: Lord Kåñëa is the supreme predominator, and all living
entities, including the great demigods , are His subordinates. One can attain
perfect peace only in complete Kåñëa cons ciousness.
This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Kåñëa consciousness,
generally known as karma-yoga.  The question of mental speculation as to how
karma-yoga  can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kåñëa
consciousness is to work with the comple te knowledge of the Lord as the
predominator. Such work is not diffe rent from transcendental knowledge.
Direct Kåñëa consciousness is bhakti-yoga,  and jïäna-yoga  is a path leading to
bhakti-yoga.  Kåñëa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one’s
relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this
consciousness is full knowledge of Kå ñëa, or the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal serv ant of God as His fragmental part andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.parcel. He comes into contact with mäyä (illusion) due to the desire to lord it
over mäyä,  and that is the cause of his many  sufferings. As long as he is in
contact with matter, he has to execute wo rk in terms of material necessities.
Kåñëa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual lif e even while one is
within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by
practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed
from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everyt hing
depends on one’s practical performance of duties in Kåñëa consciousness,
which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence
of desire and anger. And one who stands fast in Kåñëa consciousness,
controlling the abovementioned passions, remains factually in the
transcendental stage, or brahma-nirväëa.  The eightfold yoga mysticism is
automatically practiced in Kåñëa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is
served. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama,
äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna  and samädhi.  But these only
preface perfection by devotional servic e, which alone can award peace to the
human being. It is the highest perfection of life.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Karma-yoga,  or Action in Kåñëa Consciousness.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead sa id: One who is unattached to the

PURPORT
In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga
system is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very
difficult for people in general to perf orm, especially in the Age of Kali.
Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord
emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga,  or acting in Kåñëa consciousness, is
better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their
paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest , some personal
gratification, be it concentrated or ex tended. The criterion of perfection is to
act in Kåñëa consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.To act in Kåñëa consciousness is the duty  of every living entity because all ar e
constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work
for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for
self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the
living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for
personal satisfaction is the perfect sannyäsé,  the perfect yogi.
The sannyäsés  sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated
from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yajïas
(fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is to
become one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any
material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yogé
who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material
activities, desires some satisfaction for his per sonal self. But a person acting in
Kåñëa consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without
self-interest. A Kåñëa conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His
criterion of success is the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and thus he is the p erfect
sannyäsé,  or perfect yogé. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of
renunciation, prays in this way:
na dhanaà na janaà na sundaréà
kavitäà vä jagad-éça kämaye
mama janmani janmanéçvare
bhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi
“O Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy
beautiful women. Nor do I want any number of followers. What I want only is
the causeless mercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth.”

TRANSLATION
What is called renunciation you should know to be the same as yoga, or
linking oneself with the Supreme, O son of Päëòu, for one can never become a
yogé unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification.
PURPORT
Real sannyäsa-yoga  or bhakti  means that one should know his constitutional
position as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no
separate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme.
When he is entrapped by materia l energy, he is conditioned, and when he is
Kåñëa conscious, or aware of the spiritua l energy, then he is in his real and
natural state of life. Therefore, when on e is in complete knowledge, one ceases
all material sense gratification, or renounces all kin ds of sense gratificatory
activities. This is practiced by the yogés  who restrain the senses from material
attachment. But a person in Kåñëa consciousness has no opportunity to engage
his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of Kåñëa. Therefore,  a
Kåñëa conscious person is simultaneously a sannyäsé  and a yogé. The purpose of
knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the jïäna  and yoga
processes, is automatically served in Kåñëa consciousness. If one is unable to
give up the activi ties of his selfish nature, then jïäna  and yoga are of no avail.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be
prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A Kåñë a conscious person has no desire for
any kind of self-enjoyment. He is  always engaged for the enjoyment of the
Supreme. One who has no informatio n of the Supreme must therefore be
engaged in self-satisfaction, because no one can stand on the platform of
inactivity. All purposes are perfectly served by the practice of Kåñëa
consciousness.

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called yoga.  It may be
compared to a ladder for attaining th e topmost spiritual realization. This
ladder begins from the lowest material co ndition of the living entity and rises
up to perfect self-realizat ion in pure spiritual life. According to various
elevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names. But all
in all, the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts,
namely jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga  and bhakti-yoga.  The beginning of the ladder
is called the yogärurukñu  stage, and the highest rung is called yogärüòha.
Concerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to enter
into meditation through regulative princi ples of life and practice of different
sitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered
fruitive material activities.  All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental
equilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the practice of
meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.
A Kåñëa conscious person, however, is situated from the beginning on the
platform of meditation because he a lways thinks of Kåñëa. And, being
constantly engaged in the service of Kåñëa,  he is considered to have ceased all
material activities.

A person is said to be elevated in yoga when, having renounced all material
desires, he neither acts for sense gratific ation nor engages in fruitive activities.
PURPORT
When a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the
Lord, he is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense
gratification or in fruitive activities. Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense
gratification, since one c annot live without engagement. Without Kåñëa
consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish
activities. But a Kåñëa conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction
of Kåñëa and thereby be perfectly detached from sense g ratification. One who
has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before
being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder.

One must deliver himself with the help of his mind, and not degrade himself.
The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.
PURPORT
The word ätmä  denotes body, mind and soul—depending upon different
circumstances. In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are
especially important. Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, ätmä
refers here to the mind. The purpos e of the yoga system is to control the mind
and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that
the mind must be so trained that it ca n deliver the conditioned soul from the
mire of nescience. In material existence one is subje cted to the influence of
the mind and the senses. In fact, the pu re soul is entangled in the material
world because the mind is involved with the false ego, which desires to lord it
over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it wil l not
be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned
soul may be saved. One should not de grade oneself by attraction to sense
objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes
entangled in material e xistence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to
always engage the mind in Kåñëa consciousness. The word hi i s  u s e d  f o r
emphasizing this point, i.e., that one must  do this. It is also said:
mana eva manuñyäëäà

“For man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation.

cause of supreme liberation.

For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for

PURPORT
The purpose of practicing eightfold yoga is to control the mind in order to
make it a friend in discharging the human mission. Unless the mind is
controlled, the practice of yoga (for show) is simply a waste of time. One who
cannot control his mind lives a lways with the greatest enemy, and thus his life
and its mission are spoiled. The constitution al position of the living entity is toCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.carry out the order of the superior. As long as one’s mind remains an
unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of  lust, anger, avarice,
illusion, etc. But when the mind is conq uered, one voluntarily agrees to abide
by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the
heart of everyone as Paramätmä. Real yoga practice entails meeting the
Paramätm ä within the heart and then follo wing His dictation. For one who
takes to Kåñëa consciousness directly, pe rfect surrender to the dictation of the
Lord follows automatically.

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Actually, every living entity is intend ed to abide by the dictation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone’s heart as
Paramätmä. When the mind is misled by the external, illusory energy, one
becomes entangled in material activitie s. Therefore, as soon as one’s mind is
controlled through one of the yoga systems, one should be considered to have
already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When
one’s mind is fixed on the superior nature, he has no alternat ive but to follow
the dictation of the Supreme. The mind  must admit some superior dictation
and follow it. The effect of controlling  the mind is that one automatically
follows the dictation of the Paramätmä, or Supersoul. Because this
transcendental positi on is at once achieved by one who is in Kåñëa
consciousness, the devotee of the Lord  is unaffected by the dualities of
material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This
state is practical samädhi,  or absorption in the Supreme.

realization. Such a person is situated in  transcendence and is self-controlled. He
sees everything—whethe r it be pebbles, stones or gold—as the same.
PURPORT
Book knowledge without realization of the Supreme Truth is useless. This is
stated as follows:
ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi

svayam eva sphuraty adaù
“No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form,
quality and pastimes of Çré Kåñëa through his materially contaminated senses.
Only when one becomes spiritually satura ted by transcendental service to the
Lord are the transcendental name,  form, quality and pastimes of the Lord
revealed to him.” ( Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  1.2.234 )
This Bhagavad-gétä  is the science of Kåñëa consciousness. No one can
become Kåñëa conscious simply by mundane scholarship. One must be
fortunate enough to associate with a pe rson who is in pure consciousness. A
Kåñëa conscious person has realized knowledge , by the grace of Kåñëa, because
he is satisfied with pure devotional service. By realized knowledge, one
becomes perfect. By transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his
convictions, but by mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and
confused by apparent contradictions. It is the realized soul who is actually
self-controlled, because he is surrendered to Kåñëa. He is transcendental
because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship. For him mundane
scholarship and mental speculation, which may be as good as gold to others, are
of no greater value than pebbles or stones.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  9

satatam —constantly; ätmänam —himself (by body, mind and self); rahasi —in
a secluded place; sthitaù —being situated; ekäké —alone;

TRANSLATION
A transcendentalist should always engage his body, mind and self in
relationship with the Supreme; he should live alone in a secluded place and
should always carefully control his mind. He should be free from desires and
feelings of possessiveness.
PURPORT
Kåñëa is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Paramätmä and the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kåñëa consciousness means, concisely, to be
always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those
who are attached to the impersonal B rahman or the localized Supersoul are
also partially Kåñëa conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray
of Kåñëa and Supersoul is the all-perv ading partial expansion of Kåñëa. Thus
the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly Kåñëa  conscious. A
directly Kåñëa conscious person is th e topmost transcendentalist because such
a devotee knows what is meant by Br ahman and Paramätmä. His knowledge of
the Absolute Truth is perfect, wherea s the impersonalist and the meditative
yogé are imperf ectly Kåñëa conscious.
Nevertheless, all of these are instructed  herewith to be constantly engaged
in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection
sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mindCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.always on Kåñëa. One sho uld always think of Kåñëa and not forget Him even
for a moment. Concentration of th e mind on the Supreme is called samädhi,  or
trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in
seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He sho uld be very careful
to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his
realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after
unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.
All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is
directly in Kåñëa consciousness, because direct Kåñëa consciousness means
self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness.
Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé characte rizes Kåñëa consciousness in this way:
anäsaktasya viñayän
yathärham upayuïjataù
nirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe
yuktaà vairägyam ucyate
präpaïcikatayä buddhyä

mumukñubhiù parityägo
vairägyaà phalgu kathyate
“When one is not attached to anythi ng, but at the same time accepts
everything in relation to Kåñëa, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.
On the other hand, one who rejects ev erything without knowledge of its
relationship to Kåñëa is not as comple te in his renunciation.”
(Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  2.255–256 )
A Kåñëa conscious person well knows that  everything belongs to Kåñëa, and
thus he is always free from feelings of  personal possession. As such, he has no
hankering for anything on his own pers onal account. He knows how to accept
things in favor of Kåñëa co nsciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to
Kåñëa consciousness. He is always aloof  from material things because he is
always transcendental, and he is alwa ys alone, having nothing to do with
persons not in Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore a person i n Kåñëa consciousness
is the perfect yogé.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXTS  11–12

To practice yoga, one should go to a se cluded place and should lay kuça grass
on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat
should be neither too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The yogé should then s it on it very firmly and practice yoga to purify the heart
by controlling his mind, senses and activities and fixing the mind on one point.
PURPORT
“Sacred place” refers to places  of pilgrimage. In India the yogés,  the
transcendentalists or the devotees, all leave home and reside in sacred places
such as Prayäga, Mathurä, Våndävana, Håñékeça and Hardwar and in solitude
practice yoga where the sacred r ivers like the Yamunä and the Ganges flow.
But often this is not possible, especially for Westerners. The so-called yoga
societies in big cities may be successful  in earning material benefit, but they
are not at all suitable for the actual practice of yoga. One who is not
self-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation.
Therefore, in the Båhan-näradéya Puräëa  it is said that in Kali-yuga (the
present yuga,  or age), when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual
realiz ation and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of
spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord.
harer näma harer näma
harer nämaiva kevalam
kalau nästy eva nästy eva
nästy eva gatir anyathä
 [Adi 17.21]
“In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is
chanting the holy name of the Lord. Ther e is no other way. There is no other
way. There is no other way.”

One should hold one’s body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare
steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus, with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid
of fear, completely free from sex life, on e should meditate upon Me within the
heart and make Me th e ultimate goal of life.
PURPORT
The goal of life is to know Kåñëa, wh o is situated within the heart of every
living being as Paramätmä, th e four-handed Viñëu form. The yoga process is
practiced in order to discover and see th is localized form of Viñëu, and not forCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.any other purpose. The localized viñëu-mürti  is the plenary representation of
Kåñëa dwelling within one’s heart. On e who has no program to realize this
viñëu-mürti  is uselessly engaged in mock yoga practice and is certainly wasting
his time. Kåñëa is the ultimate goal of life, a nd the viñëu-mürti  situated in one’s
heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this viñëu-mürti  within the heart,
one has to observe complete abstinence  from sex life; therefore one has to
leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining sea ted as mentioned
above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a
so-called yoga class and thus become a yogé. One has to practice controlling the
mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratif ication, of which sex life is the chief.
In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yäjïavalkya it is said:
karmaëä manasä väcä
sarvävasthäsu sarvadä
sarvatra maithuna-tyägo
brahmacaryaà pracakñate
“The vow of brahmacarya  is meant to help one completely abstain from sex
indulgence in work, words and mind—at all times, under all circumstances,
and in all places.” No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex
indulgence. Brahmacarya  is taught, t herefore, from childhood, when one has
no knowledge of sex life. Children at  the age of five are sent to the guru-kula,
or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the
strict discipline of becoming brahmacärés.  Without suc h practice, no one can
make advancement in any yoga,  whether it be dhyäna, jïäna  or bhakti.  One
who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having a sexual
relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also calle d a
brahmacäré.  Such a restrained householder brahmacäré  may be accepted in the
bhakti  school, but the jïäna  and dhyäna  schools do not even admit householder
brahmacärés.  They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the
bhakti  school, a househol der brahmacäré  is allowed controlled sex life because
the cult of bhakti-yoga  is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual
attraction, being engaged in the supe rior service of the Lord. In the
Bhagavad-gétä  (2.59) it is said:Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.viñayä vinivartante
nirähärasya dehinaù
rasa-varjaà raso ’py asya
paraà dåñövä nivartate
Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a
devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other
than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.
Vigata-bhéù.  One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Kåñëa
consciousness. A conditioned soul is fe arful due to his perverted memory, his
forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Kåñëa. The Bhägavatam  (11.2.37 )
says, bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù s yäd éçäd apetasya viparyayo ’småtiù.  Kåñëa
consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is
possible for a person who is Kåñëa cons cious. And since the ultimate goal of
yoga practice is to see the Lord within, a Kåñëa consci ous person is already the
best of all yogés.  The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are
different from those of the popular so-called yoga societies.

TRANSLATION
Thus practicing constant control of the body, mind and activities, the mystic
transcendentalist, his mind regulated, attains to the kingdom of God [or the
abode of Kåñëa] by cessation of material existence.
PURPORT
The ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained. Yoga  practice
is not meant for attaining any kind of ma terial facility; it is to enable the
cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health
or aspires after material  perfection is no yogé according to Bhagavad-gétä.  Nor
does cessation of material existence en tail one’s entering into “the void,”
which is only a myth. There is no void  anywhere within the creation of the
Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the
spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. Th e abode of the Lord is also clearly
described in the Bhagavad-gétä  as that place where there is no need of sun,
moon or electricity. All the plan ets in the spiritual kingdom are
self-ill uminated like the sun in the mate rial sky. The kingdom of God is
everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called paraà
dhäma,  or superior abodes.
A consummate yogé, who is perfect in understanding Lord Kåñëa, as is
clearly stated herein by the Lord Himself ( mat-cittaù, mat-paraù,
mat-sthänam ), can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme
abode, Kåñëaloka, known as Goloka Våndävana. In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.37)
it is clearly stated, goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù:  the Lord, although
residing always in His abode called Go loka, is the all-pervading Brahman and
the localized Paramätmä as well by dint  of His superior spiritual energies . No
one can reach the spiritual sky (Vaikuëöha) or enter into the Lord’s eternal
abode (Goloka Våndävana) without the proper understanding of Kåñëa and
His plenary expansion Viñëu. Therefore a person working in Kåñëa
consciousness is the perfect yogé, bec ause his mind is always absorbed inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Kåñëa’s activities ( sa vai manaù kåñëa-pädäravindayoù ). In the Vedas  also
(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  3.8) we learn, tam eva viditväti måtyum eti:  “One can
overcome the path of birth and deat h only by understanding the Suprem e
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.” In other words, perfection of the yoga system
is the attainment of freedom from ma terial existence and not some magical
jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people.

TRANSLATION
There is no possibility of one’s becoming a yogé, O Arjuna, if one eats too
much or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.
PURPORT
Regulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the yogés.  Too much
eating means eating more than is requir ed to keep the body and soul together.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.There is no need for men to eat animal s, because there is an ample supply of
grains, vegetables, fruits  and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in
the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-gétä.  Animal food is for those
in the mode of ignorance. Therefore,  those who indulge in animal food,
drinking, smoking and eating food which is not firs t offered to Kåñëa will
suffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things. Bhuïjate te tv
aghaà päpä ye pacanty ätma-käraëät . Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or
cooks for himself, not offering his food to Kåñëa, eats only sin. One who eats
sin and eats more than is allo tted to him cannot execute perfect yoga.  It is best
that one eat only the remnants of f oodstuff offered to Kåñëa. A person in
Kåñëa consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to Kåñëa.
Therefore, only the Kåñëa conscious person can attain perfection in yoga
practice. Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his
own personal process of fasting, practice yoga.  The Kåñëa conscious person
observes fasting as it is recommended in the scri ptures. He does not fast or eat
more than is required, and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One
who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must
consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more t han six
hours daily. One who sleeps more than si x hours out of twenty-four is certainly
influenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is
lazy and prone to sleep a great deal. Such a person cannot perform yoga.

He who is regulated in his habits of eating, sleeping, recreation and work can

PURPORT
Extravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and
mating—which are demands of the body—can block advancement in the
practice of yoga.  As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when
one is practiced to take and accept prasädam,  sanctified food. Lord Kåñëa is
offered, according to the Bhagavad-gétä  (9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits,
grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in Kåñëa consciousness becomes
automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption,
or no t in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a Kåñëa
conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in Kåñëa
consciousness , and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered
a great loss. Avyartha-kälatvam:  [Cc. Madhya 23.18-19 ] a Kåñëa conscious
person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the
service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleep ing is kept to a minimum. His ideal in
this respect is Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, who was always engaged in the service of
Kåñëa and who could not sleep more than  two hours a day, and sometimes not
even that. Öhäkura Haridäsa would not even accept prasädam  nor even sleep
for a moment without finishing his dail y routine of chanting with his beads
three hundred  thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a Kåñëa conscious
person does not do anything which is not connected with Kåñëa’s interest, andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.thus his work is always regulated and is  untainted by sense gratification. Since
there is no question of sense gra tification, there is no material leisure for a
person in Kåñëa consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work,
speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material
misery for him.

that he can no l onger be disturbed by any kind of material desire. This
perfectional stage can automatically be attained by persons in Kåñëa
consciousness, as stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (9.4.18–20 ):

“King Ambaréña first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord
Kåñëa; then, one after another, he en gaged his words in describing the
transcendental qualities of the Lord, hi s hands in mopping the temple of the
Lord, his ears in hearing of the acti vities of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the
transcendental forms of the Lord, his body in touching the bodies of the
devotees, his sense of smell in smelling the scents of the lotus flowers offered to
the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulasé  leaf offered at the lotus feet of the
Lord, his legs in going to places of pi lgrimage and the temple of the Lord, his
head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in executing the
mission of the Lord. All these transcendental activities are quite befittin g a
pure devotee.”
This transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers
of the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person
in Kåñëa consciousness, as is appare nt in the above description of the
engagements of Mahäräja Ambar éña. Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feetCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are
not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed
activities are called arcana,  or engaging all the sen ses in the service of the
Lord. The senses and the mind require en gagements. Simple abnegation is not
practical. Therefore, for people in gene ral—especially those who are not in the
renounced order of life—transcendenta l engagement of the senses and the
mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement,
which is called yukta  in the Bhagavad-gétä.

TRANSLATION
In the stage of perfection called trance, or samädhi, one’s mind is completely
restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This perfection is
characterized by one’s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and
rejoice in t he self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless
transcendental happiness, realized thro ugh transcendental senses. Established
thus, one never departs from the truth, an d upon gaining this he thinks there is
no greater gain. Being situated in su ch a position, one is never shaken, even in
the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries
arising from material contact.
PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts.
This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one
becomes situated in trance, or samädhi,  which means that the yogé realizes the
Supersoul through transc endental mind and intelligence, without any of the
misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga  practice is more or
less based on the principles of the Pataïjali system. Some unauthorized
commentators try to identify the individual soul with  the Supersoul, and the
monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real
purpose of the Pataïjali system of yoga.  There is an acceptance of
transcendental pleasure in the Pataïjal i system, but the monists do not accept
this transcen dental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness.
The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in
this verse transcendental pleasure—realized through transcendental
senses—is accepted. And this is corroborate d by Pataïjali Muni, the famous
exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-sütras  (3.34):
puruñärtha-çünyänäà guëänäà pratiprasavaù kaivalyaà svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä
citi-çaktir iti.
This citi-çakti,  or internal potency, is transcendental. Puruñärtha  means
material religiosity, economic developmen t, sense gratification and, at the end,
the attempt to become one with th e Supreme. This “oneness with the
Supreme” is called kaivalyam  by th e monist. But according to Pataïjali, this
kaivalyam  is an internal, or transcendental , potency by which the living entity
becomes aware of his constitutional posi tion. In the words of Lord Caitanya,
this state of affairs is called ceto-darpaëa-märjanam  [Cc. Antya 20.12 ], or
clearance of the impure mirror of th e mind. This “clearance” is actually
liberation, or bhava-mahä-dävägni-nirväpaëam.  The theory of nirväëa —also
preliminary—corresponds with this principle. In the Bhägavatam  (2.10.6 ) this
is called svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù.  The Bhagavad-gétä  also confirms this situation
in this verse.
After nirväëa,  or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual
activities, or devotional service to th e Lord, known as Kåñëa consciousness. In
the words of the Bhägavatam,  svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù:  this is the “real life of the
living entity.”  Mäyä,  or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminatedCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.by material infection. Liberation from  this material infection does not mean
destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Pataïjali also
accepts this by his words kaivalyaà svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä citi-çaktir iti.  This
citi-çakti,  or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the
Vedänta-sütra  (1.1.12 ) as änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät.  This natural transcendental
pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily  achieved by execution of
devotional service, or bhakti-yoga.  Bhakti-yoga  will be vividly described in the
Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.
In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of
samädhi,  called samprajïäta-samädhi  and asamprajïäta-samädhi.  When one
becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical
researches, he is said to have achieved  samprajïäta-samädhi.  In the
asamprajïäta-samädhi  there is no longer any connection with mundane
pleasure, for one is then transcendental  to all sorts of happiness derived from
the senses. When the yogé is once situated in that  transcendental position, he
is never shaken from it. Unless the yogé is able to reach this position, he is
unsuccessful. Today’s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense
pleasures, is contradictory. A yogé indulging in sex and intoxication is a
mockery. Even those yogés  who are attracted by the siddhis  (perfections) in the
process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If yogés  are attracted by the
by-products of yoga,  then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is
stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of
gymnastic feats or siddhis  should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.
The best practice of yoga in this age is Kåñëa consciousness, which is not
baffling. A Kåñëa conscious person is so  happy in his occupation that he does
not aspire after any other happiness. Th ere are many impediments, especially
in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing haöha-yoga, dhyäna-yoga  and jïäna-yoga,
but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga  or bhakti-yoga.
As long as the material body exists , one has to meet the demands of the
body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in
pure bhakti-yoga,  or in Kåñëa consciousness, does not arouse the senses while
meeting the demands of the bod y. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of
life, making the best use of a bad barg ain, and enjoys transcendental happinessCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.in Kåñëa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences—such as
accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a m ost dear relative—but he
is always alert to execute his duties in Kåñëa consciousness, or bhakti-yoga.
Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä
(2.14), ägamäpäyino ’nityäs täàs titikñasva bhärata.  He endures all such
incide ntal occurrences because he knows th at they come and go and do not
affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga
practice.

TRANSLATION
One should engage oneself in the prac tice of yoga with determination andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.faith and not be deviated from the path. One should abandon, without
exception, all material desires born of mental speculation and thus control all
the senses on all sides by the min d.
PURPORT
The yoga practitioner should be determin ed and should patiently prosecute
the practice without deviation. One shou ld be sure of success at the end and
pursue this course with great persever ance, not becoming discouraged if there
is any delay in the attainm ent of success. Success is sure for the rigid
practitioner. Regarding bhakti-yoga,  Rüpa Gosvämé says:
utsähän niçcayäd dhairyät
tat-tat-karma-pravartanät
saìga-tyägät sato våtteù
ñaòbhir bhaktiù prasidhyati
“One can execute the process of bhakti-yoga  successfully with full-hearted
enthusiasm, perseverance, and determination, by following the prescribed
duties in the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities
of goodness.” ( Upadeçämåta  3)
As for determination, one should fo llow the example of the sparrow who
lost her eggs in the waves of the ocean.  A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of
the ocean, but the big ocean carried away  the eggs on its waves. The sparrow
became very upset and asked  the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not
even consider her appeal. So the spa rrow decided to dry up the ocean. She
began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for
her impossible determination. The news of her activity  spread, and at last
Garuòa, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Viñëu, heard it. He became
compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow.
Garuòa was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he
promised to h elp. Thus Garuòa at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest
he himself take up the work of the spa rrow. The ocean was frightened at this,
and returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garuòa.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Similarly, the practice of yoga,  especially bhakti-yoga  in Kåñëa
consciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the
principles with great determination, th e Lord will surely help, for God helps
those who help themselves.

Gradually, step by step, one should be come situated in trance by means of

PURPORT
By proper conviction and intelligence one should gradually cease sense
activities. This is called pratyähära.  The mind, being controlled by conviction,
meditation, and cessation from the sens es, should be situated in trance, or
samädhi.  At that time there is no longer any danger of becoming engaged inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the material conception of life. In othe r words, although one is involved with
matter as long as the material body ex ists, one should not think about sense
gratification. One should think of no pleasure aside from the pleasure of the
Supreme Self. This state is easily attained by directly practicing Kåñëa
consciousness.

happiness, the senses are engaged in the service of Håñékeça, or the supreme
owner of the senses—Kåñëa. Serving Kåñëa with purif ied senses is called Kåñëa
consciousness. That is the way of brin ging the senses under full control. What
is more, that is the highest perfection of yoga practice.

affected by His presence in either a dog or a brähmaëa.  That is the supremeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.neutrality of the Lord. The indivi dual soul is also situated in  the individual
heart, but he is not present in all hear ts. That is the distinction between the
individual soul and the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of
yoga cannot see so clearly. A Kåñëa conscious person can see Kåñëa in the
heart o f both the believer and the nonbeliever. In the småti  this is confirmed
as follows: ätatatväc ca mätåtväc ca ätmä hi paramo hariù . The Lord, being the
source of all beings, is like the moth er and the maintainer. As the mother is
neutral to all different ki nds of children, the supreme father (or mother) is
also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.
Outwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As
will be explained in the Seventh Chapter , the Lord has, primarily, two
energies—the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living
entity, although part of th e superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior
energy; the living entity is always in the Lord’s energy. Every living entity is
situated in Him in one way or another.
The yogé sees equally because he sees that  all living entities, although in
different situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all
circumstances remain the servants of Go d. While in the material energy, the
living entity serves the material  senses; and while in spiritual energy, he serves
the Supreme Lord directly. In either ca se the living entity is the servant of
God. This vision of equality is perfect in a person in Kåñëa consciousness.

For one who sees Me everywhere and sees  everything in Me, I am never lost,

PURPORT
A person in Kåñëa consciousness certainly sees Lord Kåñëa everywhere, and
he sees everything in Kåñëa. Such a person may appear to see all separate
manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is
conscious of Kåñëa, knowing that  everything is a manifestation of Kåñëa’s
energy. Nothing can exist without Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is the Lord of
everything—this is the basic principle of Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa
consciousness is the development of lo ve of Kåñëa—a position transcendental
even to material liberation. At this stage of Kåñëa consciousness, beyond
self-realization, the devotee becomes on e with Kåñëa in the sense that Kåñëa
becomes everything for the devotee and the devotee becomes full in loving
Kåñëa. An intimate relationship be tween the Lord and the devotee then exists.
In that stage, the living entity can neve r be annihilated, nor is the Personality
of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in Kåñëa is spiritual
annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä
(5.38):
premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti
yaà çyämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpaà

whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of  love. He is seen in His eternal form
of Çyämasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.”
At this stage, Lord Kåñëa never disa ppears from the sight of the devotee,
nor does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord. In the case of a yogé who sees
the Lord as Paramätmä within the heart, the same applies. Such a yogé turns
into a pure devotee and c annot bear to live for a moment without seeing the
Lord within himself.

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.A yogé who is practicing meditation on the Supersoul sees within himself
the plenary portion of Kåñëa as Viñëu— with four hands, holding conchshell,
wheel, club and lotus flower. The yogé should know that Viñëu is not different
from Kåñëa. Kåñëa in this for m of Supersoul is situated in everyone’s heart.
Furthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls
present in the innumerable hearts of li ving entities. Nor is there a difference
between a Kåñëa conscious person always engaged in the tr anscendental loving
service of Kåñëa and a perfect yogé engaged in meditation on the Supersoul.
The yogé in Kåñëa consciousness—even though he may be engaged in various
activities while in material existence— remains always situated in Kåñëa. This
is confir med in the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.2.187 ) of Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé:
nikhiläsv apy avasthäsu jévan-muktaù sa ucyate.  A devotee of the Lord, always
acting in Kåñëa consciousness, is automatically liberated. In the
Närada-païcarätra  this is confirmed in this w ay:
dik-kälädy-anavacchinne
kåñëe ceto vidhäya ca
tan-mayo bhavati kñipraà
jévo brahmaëi yojayet
“By concentrating one’s attention on the transcendental form of Kåñëa,
who is all-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in
thinking of Kåñëa and then attains the happy state of transcendental
association with Him.”
Kåñëa consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice. This
very understanding that Kåñëa is pres ent as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart
makes the yogé faultless. The Vedas  (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.21) confirm this
inconceivable potency of the Lord as follows: eko ’pi san bahudhä yo ’vabhäti.
“ A l t h o u g h  t h e  L o r d  i s  o n e ,  H e  i s  p r esent in innumerable hearts as many.”
Similarly, in the småti-çästra  it is said:
eka eva paro viñëuù

“Viñëu is one, and yet He is certainly  all-pervading. By His inconceivable
potency, in spite of His one form, He is  present everywhere, as the sun appears
in many places at once.”

cause of happiness is  knowing Kåñëa to be the supreme enjoyer of all the
activities of the human being, the proprietor of all lands and planets, and theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.sincerest friend of all living entities. The perfect yogé knows that the living
being who is conditioned by the modes of mat erial nature is subjected to the
threefold material miseries due to forget fulness of his relationship with Kåñëa.
And because one in Kåñëa consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the
knowledge of Kåñëa everywhere. Since the perfect yogé tries to bro adcast the
importance of becoming Kåñëa conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the
world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord. Na ca tasmän manuñyeñu
kaçcin me priya-kåttamaù  (Bg. 18.69 ). In other words, a devotee of the Lord
always looks to th e welfare of all living entities, and in this way he is factually
the friend of everyone. He is the best yogé because he does not desire
perfection in yoga for his personal benefit, but tries for others also. He does
not envy his fellow living entities. He re is a contrast between a pure devotee of
the Lord and a yogé interested only in his personal elevation. The yogé who has
withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as
perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward Kåñëa
consciousness.

Arjuna said: O Madhusüdana, the system of yoga which You have
summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless
and unsteady.
PURPORT
The system of mysticism described by Lord Kåñëa to Arjuna beginning with
the words çucau deçe  and ending with yogé paramaù  is here being rejected by
Arjuna out of a feeling of inability. It  is not possible for an ordinary man to
leave home and go to a secl uded place in the mountain s or jungles to practice
yoga in this Age of Kali. The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle
for a life of short duration. People are not serious about self-realization even by
simple, practical means, and what to spea k of this difficult yoga system, which
regulates the mode of living, the manne r of sitting, selection of place, and
detachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man,
Arjuna thought it was impossibl e to follow this system of yoga,  even t hough he
was favorably endowed in many ways. He belonged to the royal family and was
highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had
great longevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord Kåñëa,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had
much better facilities than we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of
yoga.  In fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any
time. Therefore this system must be c onsidered generally impossible in this
Age of Kali. Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for
the people in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five thousand
years ago, then what of the present day? Those who are i mitating this yoga
system in different so-called schools an d societies, although complacent, are
certainly wasting their time. They are completely in ignorance of the desiredCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.goal.

For the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Kåñëa, and

PURPORT
The mind is so strong and obstinat e that it sometimes overcomes the
intelligence, although the mind is supposed to be subservient to the
intelligence. For a man in the practical world who has to fight so many
opposing elements, it is certainly very difficu lt to control the mind.
Artificially, one may establish a mental  equilibrium toward both friend and
enemy, but ultimately no worldly man can do so, for this is more difficult than
controlling the raging wind. In the Vedic literature ( Kaöha Upaniñad  1.3.3–4 )

“The individual is the passenger in  the car of the material body, and
intelligence is the driver. Mind is the driving instrument, and the senses are
the horses. The self is thus the enjoye r or sufferer in the association of the
mind and senses. So it is un derstood by great thinkers.” Intelligence is
supposed to direct the mind, but the mind  is so strong and obstinate that it
often overcomes even one’s own intelligenc e, as an acute infection may surpass
the efficacy of medicine. Such a strong mind is suppose d to be controlled by
the practice of yoga,  but such practice is never practical for a worldly person
like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man? The simile used here is
appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more
difficult to  capture the turbulent mind. The ea siest way to control the mind, as
suggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting “Hare Kåñëa,” the great mantra  for
deliverance, in all humility. The method prescribed is sa vai manaù
kåñëa-pädäravindayoù : one must engage one’s mind fully in Kåñëa. Only then
will there remain no other engagements to agitate the mind.

TRANSLATION
Lord Çré Kåñëa said: O mighty-armed son of Kunté, it is undoubtedly very
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by suitable practice and by
detachment.
PURPORT
The difficulty of controlling the obstin ate mind, as expressed by Arjuna, is
accepted by the Personality of Godhead.  But at the same time He suggests that
by practice and detachment it is possible.  What is that practice? In the present
age no one can obser ve the strict rules and regula tions of placing oneself in a
sacred place, focusing the mind on th e Supersoul, restraining the senses and
mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of Kåñëa
consciousness, however, one engages in nine ty pes of devotional service to the
Lord. The first and foremost of such de votional engagements is hearing about
Kåñëa. This is a very powerful transc endental method for purging the mind of
all misgivings. The more one hears about Kåñëa, the more one becomes
enlightened and detached from everyt hing that draws the mind away from
Kåñëa. By detaching the mind from acti vities not devoted to the Lord, one can
very easily learn vairägya.  Vairägya  means detachment from matter andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.engagement of the mind in spirit. Imp ersonal spiritual detachment is more
difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of Kåñëa. This is practical
because by hearing about Kåñëa one be comes automatically attached to the
Supreme Spirit. This attachment is called pareçänubhava,  spiritual  satisfaction.
It is just like the feeling of satisfac tion a hungry man has for every morsel of
food he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction
and strength. Similarly, by discharg e of devotional service one feels
transcendent al satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material
objectives. It is something like curi ng a disease by expert treatment and
appropriate diet. Hearing of the transc endental activities of Lord Kåñëa is
therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, an d eating the foodstuff offered
to Kåñëa is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the
process of Kåñëa consciousness.

whose mind is controlled and who strives by appropriate means is assured of
success. That is My opinion.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not
accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can
hardly achieve success in self-realization. Trying to practice yoga while
engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while
pouring water on it. Yoga  practice without mental control is a waste of time.
Such a show of yoga may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as
spiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, one must control  the mind by
engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless
one is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A
Kåñëa conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without
separate e ndeavor, but a yoga practitioner cannot achieve success without
becoming Kåñëa conscious.

Arjuna said: O Kåñëa, what is the destination of the unsuccessful
transcendentalist, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization
with faith but who later desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not
attain perfection in mysticism?
PURPORT
The path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad-gétä.
The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not
this material body but that he is diffe rent from it and that his happiness is in
eternal life, b liss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body
and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice
of the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga.  In each of these processes one has to
realize the constitutional positi on of the living entity, his relationship with
God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve
the highest perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness. Following any of the
above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner
or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter : even a little
endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out
of these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga  is especially suitable for this
age because it is the most direct meth od of God realization. To be doubly
assured, Arjuna is asking Lord Kåñëa to confirm His former statement. One
may sincerely accept the path of self-rea lization, but the process of cultivation
of knowledge and the practic e of the eightfold yoga system are generally very
difficult for this age. Therefore, desp ite constant endeavor one may fail, for
many reasons. First of all, one may no t be sufficiently serious about followingCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war
on the illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the
clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various
allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of m aterial
energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while
performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yogäc calita-mänasaù:
deviation from the transcendental path . Arjuna is inquisitive to know the
results of deviation from the  path of self-realization.

O mighty-armed Kåñëa, does not such a man, who is bewildered from the

perish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?
PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.There are two ways to progress. Those who are materialists have no interest
in transcendence; therefore they are mo re interested in material advancement
by economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by
appropriate work. When one takes to t he path of transcendence, one has to
cease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material
happiness. If the aspiring transcendentalis t fails, then he apparently loses both
ways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness  nor spiritual
success. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky
sometimes deviates from a small cloud an d joins a big one. But if it cannot join
a big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the
vast sky. The brahmaëaù pathi  is the path of transcendental realization
through knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the
Supreme Lord, who is manifested as Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän. Lord
Çré Kåñëa is the fullest manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, and
therefore one who is surrendered to  the Supreme Person is a successful
transcendentalist. To reach this goal of life through Brahman and Paramätmä
realization takes many, many births ( bahünäà janmanäm ante  [Bg. 7.19]).
Therefor e the supermost path of transcendental realization is bhakti-yoga,  or
Kåñëa consciousness, the direct method.

This is my doubt, O Kåñëa, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for
You, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.
PURPORT
Kåñëa is the perfect knower of past, present and future. In the beginning of
the Bhagavad-gétä,  the Lord said that all living entities existed individually in
the past, they exist now in the present, and they continue to retain individual
identity in the f uture, even after liberation from the material entanglement.
So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the individual living
entity. Now, Arjuna wants to know  of the future of the unsuccessful
transcendentalist. No one is equal to or above  Kåñëa, and certainly the
so-called great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material nature
cannot equal Him. Therefore the verdic t of Kåñëa is the final and complete
answer to all doubts, because He know s past, present and future perfectly—bu t
no one knows Him. Kåñëa and Kåñëa co nscious devotees alone can know what
is what.

PURPORT
In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.5.17 ) Çré Närada Muni instructs Vyäsadeva as
follows:
tyaktvä sva-dharmaà caraëämbujaà harer
bhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi
yatra kva väbhadram abhüd amuñya kià
ko värtha äpto ’bhajatäà sva-dharmataù
“If someone gives up all material prospe cts and takes complete shelter of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any way.
On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties
and yet not gain anything.”  For material prospects there are many activities,
both scriptural and customary. A transc endentalist is supposed to give up all
material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, KåñëaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.consciousness. One may argue that by Kåñëa consciousne ss one may attain the
highest perfection if it is completed,  but if one does not attain such a
perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined
in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction for not executing
prescri bed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental
activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bhägavatam
assures the unsuccessful transcendentalis t that there need be no worries. Even
though he may be subjected to the reacti on for not perfectly executing
prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious Kåñëa consciousness
is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is
lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follow s strictly
the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is
lacking in Kåñëa consciousness.
The purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into
two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are
engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next
life or spiritual salvation belong  to the nonregulated section. And those who
follow the principles of prescribed du ties in the scriptures are classified
amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and
noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are  full of animal
propensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the
animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually
remain in material existence, which is  always miserable. On the other hand,
those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually
to Kåñëa consciousness, certainly progress in life.
Those who are following the path of  auspiciousness can be divided into
three sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who
are enjoying material prosperity, (2) those who are trying to find ultimate
liberation from material exi stence, and (3) those who are devotees in Kåñëa
consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the
scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those
who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification.
Those who are after fruitive results for se nse gratification may be elevated to aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.higher standard of life—even to the high er planets—but still, because they are
not free from material existence, they are not following the truly aus picious
path. The only auspicious activities ar e those which lead one to liberation.
Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from
the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in Kåñëa
consciousne ss is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily
accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of
Kåñëa consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe
austerity. And because the eightfold yoga s y s t e m  i s  d i r e c t e d  t o w a r d  t h e
ultimate realization of Kåñëa consciousne ss, such practice is also auspicious,
and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.

PURPORT
The unsuccessful yogés  are divided into two classes: one is fallen after very
little progress, and one is fallen after long practice of yoga.  The yogé who falls
after a short period of practice goes to the higher planets, where pious living
entities are al lowed to enter. After prolonged life there, one is sent back again
to this planet, to take birth in the family of a righteous brähmaëa vaiñëava  or
of aristocratic merchants.
The real purpose of yoga practice is to achieve the highest perfection of
Kåñëa consciousness, as explained in th e last verse of this chapter. But those
who do not persevere to such an exte nt and who fail because of material
allurements are allowed, by the  grace of the Lord, to make full utilization of
their material propensities. And after th at, they are given opportunities to live
prosperous lives in righteous or aristo cratic families. Those who are born in
such families may take advantage of the faciliti es and try to elevate themselves
to full Kåñëa consciousness.

PURPORT
Birth in a family of yogés  or transcendentalists—those with great
wisdom—is praised herein because the child born in such a family receives a
spiritual impetus from the very beginning of  his life. It is especially the case in
the äcärya  or gosvämé  families . Such families are very learned and devoted by
tradition and training, and thus they be come spiritual masters. In India there
are many such äcärya  families, but they have now degenerated due to
insufficient education and trainin g. By the grace of the Lord , there are still
families that foster transcendentalis ts generation after generation. It is
certainly very fortunate to take birth in  such families. Fortunately, both our
spiritual master, Oà Viñëupäda Çré Çrémad Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté
Gosvämé Mahäräja , and our humble self had the opportunity to take birth in

TRANSLATION
By virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life, he automatically
becomes attracted to the yogic principles—even without seeking them. Such an
inquisitive transcendentalist stands always above the ritualistic principles of the
scriptures.
PURPORT
Advanced yogés  are not very much attracted to  the rituals of the scriptures,
but they automatically become attracted to the yoga principles, which can
elevate them to complete Kåñëa consciousness, the highest yoga perfection. In
the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.33.7), such disregard of Vedic rituals by the
advanced transcendentalists is explained as follows:
aho bata çva-paco ’to garéyän
yaj-jihvägre vartate näma tubhyam
tepus tapas te juhuvuù sasnur äryä
brahmänücur näma gåëanti ye te
“O my Lord! Persons who chant the holy names of Your Lordship are far,
far advanced in spiritual life, even if  born in families of dog-eaters. Such
chanters have undoubtedly performed a ll kinds of austerities and sacrifices,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.bathed in all sacred places, an d finished all scriptural studies.”
The famous example of this was pres ented by Lord Caitanya, who accepted
Öhäkura Haridäsa as one of His most important disciples. Although Öhäkura
Haridäsa happened to take his birth in a Muslim family, he was elevated to the
post of nämäcärya  b y  L o r d  C a i t a nya due to his rigidly attended principle of
chanting three hundred thousand holy names of the Lord daily: Hare Kåñëa,
Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma,
Hare Hare. And because he chanted th e holy name of the Lord constant ly, it is
understood that in his previous life  he must have passed through all the
ritualistic methods of the Vedas,  known as çabda-brahma.  Unless, therefore,
one is purified, one cannot take to th e principles of Kåñëa consciousness or
become engaged in ch anting the holy name of the Lord, Hare Kåñëa.

perfection after many, many births of practice, he attains the supreme goal.
PURPORT
A person born in a particularly righteous, aristocratic or sacred family
becomes conscious of his favorable condition for executing yoga practice. With
determination, therefore, he begins his unfinished task, and thus he
completely cleanses himself of all material contaminations. When he is finally
free from all contaminations, he a ttains the supreme perfection—Kåñëa
consciousness. Kåñëa consciousness is the perfect stage of being freed of all
contaminations. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä  (7.28):
yeñäà tv anta-gataà päpaà

A yogé is greater than the ascetic, greater than the empiricist and greater
than the fruitive worker. Therefore, O Ar juna, in all circumstances, be a yogé.
PURPORT
When we speak of yoga we refer to linking our consciousness with the
Supreme Absolute Truth. Such a process is named differently by various
practitioners in terms of the particul ar method adopted. When the linking
process is predominantly in fruitive activ ities it is called karma-yoga,  when it is
predominantly empirical it is called jïäna-yoga,  and when it is predominantly
in a devotional relationship with the Supreme Lord it is called bhakti-yoga.
Bhakti-yoga,  or Kåñëa consciousness, is the ultimate perfec tion of all yogas,  as
will be explained in the next verse.  The Lord has confirmed herein the
superiority of yoga,  but He has not mentioned that it is better than bhakti-yoga.
Bhakti-yoga  is full spiritual knowledge, an d therefore nothing can excel it.
Asce ticism without self-knowledge is im perfect. Empiric knowledge without
surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect. And fruitive work without
Kåñëa consciousness is a waste of time. Therefore, the most highly praised form
of yoga performance mentioned h ere is bhakti-yoga,  and this is still more
clearly explained in the next verse.

And of all yogés, the one with great fa ith who always abides in Me, thinks of
Me within himself, and renders transcendental loving service to Me—he is the
most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. That is My
opinion.
PURPORT
The word bhajate  is significant here. Bhajate  has its root in the verb bhaj,
which is used when there is need of  service. The English word “worship”
cannot be used in the same sense as bhaj.  Worship means to adore, or to show
respect and honor to the worth y one. But service with love and faith is
especially meant for the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead. One can avoid
worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but
one cannot avoid serving the Suprem e Lord without being thoroughl y
condemned. Every living entity is part  and parcel of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, and thus every living enti ty is intended to serve the Supreme
Lord by his own constitution. Failin g to do this, he falls down. The
Bhägavatam  (11.5.3 ) confirms this as follows:
ya eñäà puruñaà säkñäd
ätma-prabhavam éçvaramCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.na bhajanty avajänanti
sthänäd bhrañöäù patanty adhaù
“Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the
primeval Lord, who is the source of a ll living entities, will certainly fall down
from his constitutional position.”
In this verse also the word bhajanti  is used. Therefore, bhajanti  is applicable
to the Supreme Lord only, whereas th e word “worship” can be applied to
demigods or to any other common living entity. The word avajänanti,  used in
this verse of Çrémad-Bhägavat am, is also found in the Bhagavad-gétä.  Avajänanti
mäà müòhäù : “Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Lord Kåñëa.” Such fools ta k e  i t  u p o n  t h e m s e l v e s  t o  w r i t e
commentaries on the Bhagavad-gétä  without an attitude of service to the Lord.
Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti  and
the word “worship.”
The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti yoga.  All other
yogas  are but means to come to the point of bhakti  in bhakti-yoga.  Yoga  actually
means bhakti-yoga;  all other yogas  are progressions toward the destination of
bhakti-yoga.  From t he beginning of karma-yoga  to the end of bhakti-yoga  is a
long way to self-realization. Karma-yoga,  without fruitive results, is the
beginning of this path. When karma-yoga  increases in knowledge and
renunciation, the stage is called jïäna-yoga.  When jïäna -yoga  increases in
meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is
on Him, it is called añöäìga-yoga.  And when one surpasses the añöäìga-yoga
and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa, it is
called bhak ti yoga,  the culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga  is the ultimate goal,
but to analyze bhakti-yoga  minutely one has to understand these other yogas.
The yogé who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good
fortune. One who sticks to a parti cular point and does not make further
progress is called by that particular name: karma-yogé, jïäna-yogé  or
dhyäna-yogé, räja-yogé, haöha-yogé,  etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the
point of bhakti-yoga,  it is to be understood that he has surpasse d all other yogas.
Therefore, to become Kåñëa conscious is the highest stage of yoga,  just as,
when we speak of Himälayan, we refe r to the world’s highest mountains, ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.
It is by great fortune that one comes to Kåñëa consciousness on the path of
bhakti-yoga  to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal
yogé concentrates his attention on Kåñëa, who is called Çyämasundara, who is
as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun,
whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower-garlanded.
Illuminating all sides is His gorg eous luster, which is called the brahmajyoti.  He
incarnates in different forms such as R äma, Nåsiàha, Varäha and Kåñëa, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the
son of mother Yaçodä, and He is know n as Kåñëa, Govinda and Väsudeva. He
is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with al l
opulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these
features of the Lord, he is called the highest yogi.
This stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga,
as is confirmed in all Vedic literature:
yasya deve parä bhaktir
yathä deve tathä gurau
tasyaite kathitä hy arthäù
prakäçante mahätmanaù
“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and
the spiritual master are all the impo rts of Vedic knowledge automatically
revealed.” [ ÇU 6.23(526) ]
Bhaktir asya bhajanaà tad ihämutropädhi-nairäsyenämuñmin
manaù-kalpanam, etad eva naiñkarmyam.  “Bhakti  means devotional service to
the Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in
the next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the
Supreme. That is the purpose of naiñkarmya. ” (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.15)
These are some of the means for performance of bhakti,  or Kåñëa
consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.

PURPORT
In this Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä,  the nature of Kåñëa
consciousness is fully described. Kåñëa is full in all opulences, and how He
manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate
people who become attached to Kåñëa and f our kinds of unfortunate people
who never take to Kåñëa are described in this chapter.
In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä,  the living entity has been
described as nonmaterial spirit so ul capable of elevating himself to
self-realization by different types of yogas.  At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it
has been clearly stated that the s teady concentration of the mind upon Kåñëa,
or in other words Kåñëa consciousn ess, is the highest form of all yoga.  By
concentrating one’s mind upon Kåñëa, on e is able to know the Absolute Truth
completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahmajyoti  or loca lized Paramätmä
realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, because it is
partial. Full and scientific knowledge is Kåñëa, and everything is revealed to
the person in Kåñëa consciousness. In complete Kåñëa consciousness one
knows that Kåñëa  is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of
yoga are only steppingstones on the pa th of Kåñëa consciousness. One who
takes directly to Kåñëa consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti
and Paramätmä in full. By practice of Kåñëa co nsciousness yoga,  one can know
everything in full—namely the Absolu te Truth, the living entities, the
material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.
One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the
Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mi nd upon Kåñëa the Supreme is made
possible by prescribed devotional servic e in nine different forms, of which
çravaëam  is the first and most  important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna,
tac chåëu,  or “Hear from Me.” No one can be a greater authority than Kåñëa,
and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity to
become a perfectly Kåñëa conscious person. One has therefo re to learn fromCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Kåñëa directly or from a pure devotee of Kåñëa—and not from a nondevotee
upstart, puffed up with academic education.
In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  this process of understanding Kåñëa, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Ab solute Truth, is described in the
Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:
çåëvatäà sva-kathäù kåñëaù
puëya-çravaëa-kértanaù
hådy antaù-stho hy abhadräëi
vidhunoti suhåt satäm

dåñöa evätmanéçvare
“To hear about Kåñëa from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly
through the Bhagavad-gétä,  is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears
about Kåñëa, Lord Kåñëa, who is dwelli ng in everyone’s heart, acts as a
best-wishing friend and purifie s the devotee who constantly engages in
hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormantCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about Kåñëa from the
Bhägavatam  and from the devotees, he become s fixed in the devotional service
of th e Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the
modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are
diminished. When these impurities ar e wiped away, the candidate remains
steady in his position of pure goodness,  becomes enlivened by devotional
service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga  severs
the hard knot of material affection an d enables one to come at once to the
stage of asaàçayaà-samagram,  understanding of the Supreme Absolute Tru th
Personality of Godhead.” ( Bhäg.  1.2.17–21 )
Therefore only by hearing from Kåñëa or from His devotee in Kåñëa
consciousness can one understand the science of Kåñëa.

Complete knowledge includes knowle dge of the phenomenal world, the
spirit behind it, and the source of both of them. This is transcendental
knowledge. The Lord wants to expl ain the above-mentioned system of
knowledge because Arjuna is Kåñëa’s confidential devotee and friend. In the
beginning of the Fourth Chapter this explanation was given by the Lord, and
it is again confirmed here: complete kn owledge can be achieved only by the
devotee of the Lord in disciplic successi on directly from the Lord. Therefore
one should be intelligent enough to kn ow the source of all knowledge, who is
the cause of all causes and the only object for meditation in all types of yoga
practice. When the cause of all causes becomes known, then everything
knowable becomes known, and n othing remains unknown. The Vedas

Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of
those who have achieved perfection,  hardly one knows Me in truth.
PURPORT
There are various grades of men, an d out of many thousands, one may be
sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the
self, what is the body, and what is th e Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is
simply engaged in the anima l propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending
and mating, and hardly anyone is intere sted in transcendental knowledge. The
first six chapters of the Gétä are meant for those who are interested in
transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, th e Superself and the
process of realization by jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga  and discrimination of the self
from matter. However, Kåñëa can be know n only by persons who are in Kåñëa
consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman
realizatio n, for this is easier than unders tanding Kåñëa. Kåñëa is the Supreme
Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and
Paramätmä. The yogés  and jïänés  are confused in their attempts to understand
Kåñëa. Although the greatest of the imp ersonalists, Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya, has
admitted in his Gétä commentary that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, his followers do not accept Kåñëa as such, for it is very difficult to
know Kåñëa, even though one has transcendental realization of im personal
Brahman.
Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the
primeval Lord Govinda. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù/
anädir ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam . It is very difficult for the
nondevotees to know Him. Although nonde votees declare that the path of
bhakti,  or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of
bhakti  is so easy, as the nondevotee cla ss of men proclaim, then why do they
take up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti  is not  easy. The so-called
path of bhakti  practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhaktiCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.may be easy, but when it is practice d factually according to the rules and
regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path.
Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé writes in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.2.101 ):
çruti-småti-puräëädi-
païcarätra-vidhià vinä
aikäntiké harer bhaktir
utpätäyaiva kalpate
“Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic
literatures like the Upaniñads, Puräëas  and Närada-païcarätra  is simply an
unnecessary disturbance in society.”
It is not possible for the Brahma n-realized impersonalist or the
Paramätmä-realized yogé to understand Kåñëa the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as the son of mother Yaçodä or  the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the
great demigods are sometimes confused about Kå ñëa ( muhyanti yat sürayaù ).
Mäà tu veda na kaçcana : “No one knows Me as I am,” the Lord says. And if
one does know Him, then sa mahätmä su-durlabhaù . “Such a great soul is very
rare.” Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one
canno t know Kåñëa as He is ( tattvataù ), even though one is a great scholar or
philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable
transcendental qualities in Kåñëa, in the cause of all causes, in His
omnipotence and opulence, and in His wealth, fame, strength, beauty,
knowledge and renunciation, because Kåñë a is benevolently inclined to His
devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone
can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:
ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi
na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù
sevonmukhe hi jihvädau
svayam eva sphuraty adaù
“No one can understand Kåñëa as He is by the blunt material senses. But He
reveals Himself to the devotees, be ing pleased with them for their
transcendental loving service unto Him.” ( Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  1.2.234 )Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  4

“For material creation, Lord Kåñë a’s plenary expansion assumes three
Viñëus. The first one, Mahä-Viñëu, creates the total material energy, known as
the mahat-tattva.  The second, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, enters into all the
universes to create diversities in e ach of them. The third, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu,
is diffused as the all-pervading Supersou l in all the universes and is known as
Paramätmä. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these
three Viñëus can be liberated from material entanglement.”
This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of
the Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three
Viñëu expansions of Lord Kåñëa. These puruñas  are called incarnations.
Generally one who does not know  the science of God (Kåñëa) assumes that
this material world is for the enjoymen t of the living entities and that the
living entities are the puruñas —the causes, controllers and enjoyers of the
material energy. According to Bhagavad-gétä  this atheistic con clusion is false.
In the verse under discussion it is stated  that Kåñëa is the original cause of the
material manifestation. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also confirms this. The ingredients
of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the
brahmajyoti,  which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual
energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in the
brahmajyoti  as there are in the Vaikuëöhalokas, and the impersonalist accepts
this brahmajyoti  as the ultimate eternal goal. The Paramätmä manifestation is
also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. The
Paramätmä manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the
factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality o f Godhead Kåñëa. He is
the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and
internal energies.
In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above
mentioned. Out of these, the first five  manifestations, namely earth, water,
fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations,
within which the five se nse objects are included. They are the manifestations
of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises
these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the mat erialists. Philosophers who
deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do
not know the ultimate source, Kåñëa. Th e false ego—“I am,” and “It is mine,
which constitute the basic principle of  material existence—includes ten se nse
organs for material activities. Intelligenc e refers to the total material creation,
called the mahat-tattva.  Therefore from the eight separated energies of the
Lord are manifest the twenty-four elemen ts of the material world, which are
the subject matt er of Säìkhya atheistic philosophy; they are originally
offshoots from Kåñëa’s energies and ar e separated from Him, but atheistic
Säìkhya philosophers with a poor fund  of knowledge do not know Kåñëa as
the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discus sion in the Säìkhya
philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of Kåñëa, as it is
described in the Bhagavad-gétä.

Mine, which comprises the living entitie s who are exploiting the resources of
this material, inferior nature.
PURPORT
Here it is clearly mentioned that li ving entities belong to the superior
nature (or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter
manifested in different elements, name ly earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind,
intelligence and false ego. Both f orms of material nature, namely gross (earth,
etc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are prod ucts of the inferior energy. The living
entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are
the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is  due to this energy that the
entire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act
unless it is moved by the superior energy , the living entity. Energies are always
controlled by the energetic, and therefore the living entities are always
controlled by the Lord—they have no independent existence. They are never
equally powerful, as unintelligent me n think. The distinction between the
living entities and the Lord is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.87.30 ) as
follows:
aparimitä dhruväs tanu-bhåto yadi sarva-gatäs
tarhi na çäsyateti niyamo dhruva netarathä
ajani ca yan-mayaà tad avimucya niyantå bhavet
samam anujänatäà yad amataà mata-duñöatayä
“O Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and
all-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the
living entities are accepted as minute en ergies of Your Lordship, then they are
at once subject to Your supre me control. Therefore real liberation entails
surrender by the living entities to Yo ur control, and that surrender will make
them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers.
Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the mo nistic theory that
God and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.faulty and polluted opinion.”
The Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, is the only controller, and all living entities are
controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the
quality of their existence is one and th e same with the Supreme, but they are
never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and
subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets
his real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the
influence of matter upon the living entity. But  when the living entity becomes
free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage
called mukti,  or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material
illusion, thinks, “I am matter, and ma terial acquisitions are mine.” H is actual
position is realized when he is liberate d from all material ideas, including the
conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may
conclude that the Gétä confirms the living entity to be only one of the
multi-energies of Kåñëa; and when this energy is freed from material
contamination, it becomes fully Kåñëa conscious, or liberated.

All created beings have their source in these two natures. Of all that is
material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both
the origin and the dissolution.
PURPORT
Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic
field of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a
certain stage of material developmen t. Rather, this material world is
manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is
developed because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to
boyhood and then to manhood because that superior energy, spirit soul, is
present. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gi gantic universe is
developed because of the presence of the Supersoul, Viñëu. Therefore spirit
and matter, which combine to manifest this gigantic universal form, are
originally two energies of the Lord, an d consequently the Lord is the original
cause of e verything. A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely the
living entity, may be the cause of a big skyscraper, a big factory, or even a big
city, but he cannot be the cause of a bi g universe. The cause of the big universe
is the big soul, or the Supe rsoul. And Kåñëa, the Supreme, is the cause of both
the big and small souls. Therefore He is the original cause of all causes. This is
confirmed in the Kaöha Upaniñad  (2.2.13 ). Nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm.

PURPORT
There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth
is personal or impersonal. As far as Bhagavad-gétä  is concerned, the Absolute
Truth is the Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, and this is confirmed in every
step. In this verse, in parti cular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a
person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also
the affirmation of the Brahma-saàhitä:  éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù
sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù ; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Pers onality of
Godhead is Lord Kåñëa, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure,
Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These
authorities leave no doubt that the Abso lute Truth is the Supreme Person, the
cause of all cause s. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the
Vedic version given in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (3.10): tato yad uttarataraà
tad arüpam anämayam/ ya etad vidur amåtäs te bhavanti athetare duùkham
eväpiyanti.  “In the material world Brahmä, the  primeval living entity within
the universe, is understood to be th e supreme amongst the demigods, human
beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahmä there is the Transcendence,
who has no material form and is fr ee from all material contaminations.
Anyone w ho can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who doCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.”
The impersonalist puts more stress on the word arüpam.  But this arüpam  is
not impersonal. It indicates the transc endental form of eternity, bliss and
knowledge as described in the Brahma-saàhitä  quoted above. Other verses in
the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (3.8–9) substantiate this as follows:
vedäham etaà puruñaà mahäntam
äditya-varëaà tamasaù parastät
tam eva viditväti måtyum eti
nänyaù panthä vidyate ’yanäya
yasmät paraà näparam asti kiïcid
yasmän näëéyo no jyäyo ’sti kiïcit
våkña iva stabdho divi tiñöhaty ekas
tenedaà pürëaà puruñeëa sarvam
“I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all
material conceptions of darkness. Only  he who knows Him can transcend the
bonds of birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this
knowledge of that Supreme Person.
“There is no truth superior to that  Supreme Person, because He is the
supermost. He is smaller than the smalle st, and He is greater than the greatest.
He is situated as a silent tree, and He  illumines the transcendental sky, and as
a tree spreads its roots , He spreads His extensive energies.”
From these verses one concludes that  the Supreme Absolute Truth is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is  all-pervading by His multi-energies,
both material and spiritual.

O son of Kunté, I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon,

man.
PURPORT
This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material
and spiritual energies. The Supreme Lo rd can be preliminarily perceived by
His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the
demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the
sunshine, so the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His
all-pervading diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of
water. No one likes to drink sea water, because the pure taste of water is mixed
with salt. Attraction for water depends on  the purity of the taste, and this pure
taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the
presence of the Lord in water by it s taste, and the personalist also gl orifies the
Lord for His kindly supplying tasty wate r to quench man’s thirst. That is the
way of perceiving the Supreme. Practi cally speaking, there is no conflict
between personalism and impersonalism.  One who knows God knows that the
impersonal conceptio n and personal conception are simultaneously present inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.everything and that there is no co ntradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya
established His sublime doctrine: acintya
bheda -and- abheda-tattva —simultaneous oneness and difference.
The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the
brahmajyoti,  which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. And praëava,  or
the oàkära  transcendental sound in the beginning of every Vedic hymn,
addresses the Supreme Lord. Because t he impersonalists are very much afraid
of addressing the Supreme Lord Kåñëa by His innumerable names, they prefer
to vibrate the transcendental sound oàkära.  But they do not realize that
oàkära  is the sound representation of Kåñëa. The jurisdiction of Kåñë a
consciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows Kåñëa consciousness is
blessed. Those who do not know Kåñëa are in illusion, and so knowledge of
Kåñëa is liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage.

PURPORT
Puëya  means that which is not decomposed; puëya  is original. Everything in
the material world has a certain flavor or  fragrance, as the flavor and fragrance
in a flower, or in the earth, in water, in fire, in air, etc. The uncontaminated
flavor, the origin al flavor, which permeates everything, is Kåñëa. Similarly,
everything has a particular original tast e, and this taste can be changed by the
mixture of chemicals. So everything or iginal has some smell, some fragrance,
and some taste. Vibhävasu  means fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we
cannot cook, etc., and that fire is Kå ñëa. The heat in the fire is Kåñëa.
According to Vedic medicine, indigestio n is due to a low temperature in the
belly. So even for digestion fire is needed. In Kåñëa consciousne ss we become
aware that earth, water, fire, air and ev ery active principle, all chemicals and
all material elements are due to Kåñëa. The duration of man’s life is also due to
Kåñëa. Therefore by the grace of Kåñëa,  man can prolong his life or diminish
it. So Kåñëa consciousness is active in every sphere.

O son of Påthä, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the

PURPORT
Béjam  means seed; Kåñëa is the seed of everything. There are various living
entities, movable and inert. Birds, beasts, men and many other living creatures
are moving living entities; trees and plants, however, are inert—they cannot
move, but only stand. E very entity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000
species of life; some of them are moving  and some of them are inert. In all
cases, however, the seed of their life is  Kåñëa. As stated in Vedic literature,
Brahman, or the Supreme Absolute Truth, is th at from which everything is
emanating. Kåñëa is Parabrahman, the Supreme Spirit. Brahman is impersonal
and Parabrahman is personal. Impersonal  Brahman is situated in the personal
aspect—that is stated in Bhagavad-gétä.  Therefore, originally, Kåñëa is the
source of everything. He is the root. As  the root of a tree maintains the whole
tree, Kåñëa, being the original root of all things, maintains everything in this
material manifestation. This is also confirmed in the Vedic literature ( Kaöha
Upaniñad  2.2.13 ):
nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm
eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän
He is the prime eternal among all eter nals. He is the supreme living entity
of all living entities, and He alone is maintaining all life. One cannot do
anything without intelligence, and Kåñëa al so says that He is the root of all
intelligence. Unless a per son is intelligent he cannot understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.

PURPORT
All material activities in the world are being conducted under the three
modes of material nature. Although these material modes of nature are
emanations from the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, He is not subject to them. For
instance, under the state laws one may be  punished, but the king, the
lawmaker, is not subject to that law. Similarly, all the modes of material
nature—goodness, passion and ignoranc e—are emanations from the Supreme
Lord, Kåñëa, but Kåñëa is not subject to material nature. Therefore He is
nirguëa , which means that these guëas,  or modes, although issuing from Him,
do not affect Him. That is one of the special characteristics of Bhagavän, or
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Deluded by the three modes [goodness, passion and ignorance], the whole

PURPORT
The whole world is enchanted by three modes of material nature. Those
who are bewildered by these three modes cannot understand that
transcendental to this material nature is the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa.
Every living entity under the influenc e of material nature has a particular
type of body and a particular type of  psychological and biological activities
accordingly. There are four classes of  men functioning in the three material
modes of nature. Those wh o are purely in the mode of goodness are called
brähmaëas.  Those who are purely in the mode of passion are called kñatriyas.
Those who are in the modes of both  passion and ignorance are called vaiçyas.
Those who are completely in ignorance are called çüdra s. And those who are
less than that are animals or animal li fe. However, these designations are not
permanent. I may either be a brähmaëa, kñatriya.  vaiçya  or whatever—in any
case, this life is temporary. But althou gh life is temporary and we do not knowCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.what we are going to be in the next life, by the spell of this illusory energy we
consider ourselves in terms of this bodily  conception of life, and we thus think
that we are American, Indian, Russian, or brähmaëa.  Hindu, Muslim, etc. And
if we become entan gled with the modes of material  nature, then we forget the
Supreme Personality of Godhead who is behind all these modes. So Lord Kåñëa
says that living entities deluded by  these three modes of nature do not
understand that behind the material background is  the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
There are many different kinds of livi ng entities—human beings, demigods,
animals, etc.—and each and every on e of them is under the influence of
material nature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent Personality
of Godhead. Those who are in the m odes of passion and ignorance, and even
those who are in the mode of goodne ss, cannot go beyond the impersonal
Brahman conception of the Absolute Truth. They are bewildered before the
Supreme Lord in His personal featur e, which possesses all beauty, opulen ce,
knowledge, strength, fame and renunc iation. When even those who are in
goodness cannot understand, what hope is there for those in passion and
ignorance? Kåñëa consciousness is tran scendental to all these three modes of
material nature, and those who a re truly established in Kåñëa consciousness
are actually liberated.

TRANSLATION
This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature,
is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily
cross beyond it.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all
these energies are divine. Although the li ving entities are part of His energies
and are therefore divine, due to contac t with material energy their original
superior power is covered. Be ing thus covered by material energy, one cannot
possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and
spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal  superior nature of the
Lord, but due to contamination by the in ferior nature, matter, their illusion is
also eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha,  or eternally
conditioned. No one can trace out th e history of his becoming conditi oned at a
certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of
material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an
inferior energy, because material ener gy is ultimately conducted by the
supreme will, which  the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material
nature is defined herein as divine na ture due to its divine connection and
movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature,
although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the co nstruction and destruction of
the cosmic manifestation. The Vedas  confirm this as follows: mäyäà tu
prakåtià vidyän mäyinaà tu maheçvaram.  “Although mäyä  [illusion] is false or
temporary, the background of mäyä  is the supreme magician, the Personality ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Godhead, who is Maheçvara, the supreme controller.” ( Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad
4.10)
Another meaning of guëa  is rope; it is to be understood that the
conditioned soul is tightly tied by th e ropes of illusion. A man bound by the
hands and feet cannot free himself—he must be helped by a person who is
unbound. Because the bound cannot help th e bound, the rescuer must be
liberated. Therefore, only Lord Kåñëa,  or His bona fide representative the
spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help,
one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional serv ice,
or Kåñëa consciousness, can help one g ain such release. Kåñëa, being the Lord
of illusory energy, can order this in surmountable energy to release the
conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the
surrendered soul and out o f His paternal affection for the living entity, who is
originally a beloved son of the Lord. Th erefore surrender unto the lotus feet of
the Lord is the only means to get fr ee from the clutches of the stringent
material nature.
The words mäm eva  are also significant. Mäm  means unto Kåñëa (Viñëu)
only, and not Brahmä or Çiva. Although Brahmä and Çiva are greatly elevated
and are almost on the level of Viñëu, it  is not possible for such incarnations of
rajo-guëa  (passion) and tamo- guëa  (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul
from the clutches of mäyä.  In other words, both Brahmä and Çiva are also
under the influence of mäyä.  Only Viñëu is the master of mäyä;  therefore He
alone can give release to the conditioned soul. The Vedas  (Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad  3.8) confirm this in the phrase tam eva viditvä.  or “Freedom is
possible only by understanding Kåñëa.” Ev en Lord Çiva affirms that liberation
can be achieved only by the mercy of Viñëu. Lord Çiva says, mukti-pradätä
sarveñäà viñëur e va na saàçayaù:  “There is no doubt that Viñëu is the deliverer
of liberation for everyone.”

PURPORT
It is said in Bhagavad-gétä  that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus
feet of the Supreme Personality Kåñëa one can surmount the stringent laws of
material nature. At this point a ques tion arises: How is it that educated
philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of
ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa, the all-powerful
Personality of Godhead? Mukti,  or liberation from the laws of material nature,
is sought by the leaders of mankind in differen t ways and with great plans and
perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible
by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, then why don’t these intelligent and hard-working leaders a dopt this
simple method?
The Gétä answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.society like Brahmä, Çiva, Kapila, the Kumäras, Manu, Vyäsa, Devala, Asita,
Janaka, Prahläda, Bali, and later on Madhväcärya, Rämänujäcärya, Çré
Caitanya and many others—who are f aithful philosophers, politicians,
educators, scientists, etc.—surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person,
the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists,
educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as s uch for material
gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea
o f  G o d ;  t h e y  s i m p l y  m a n u f a c t u r e  t h eir own worldly plans and consequently
complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve
them. Becaus e material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the
unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of “planning
commissions.”
The atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word duñkåtinaù,  or
“miscreants.” Kåté means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist
planmaker is sometimes very intellige nt and meritorious also, because any
gigantic plan, good or bad, must  take intelligence to execute. But because the
atheist’s brain is improperly utilized in  opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord,
the atheistic planmaker is called duñkåté.  which indicates that his intelligence
and efforts are misdirected.
In the Gétä it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under
the direction of the Supreme Lord. It ha s no independent authority. It works
as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But
still material energy is very p owerful, and the atheist, due to his godless
temperament, cannot know how it works;  nor can he know the plan of the
Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the mo des of passion and ignorance, all his
plans are baffled, as in the case of Hiraëyakaçipu and Rävaëa, whose plans
were smashed to dust although they were  both materially learned as scientists,
philosophers, administrators and educators. These duñkåtinas,  or miscreants,
are of four different patterns, as outlined below.
(1) The müòhas  are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of
burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do
not want to part with them for the Su preme. The typical example of the beast
of burden is the ass. Th is humble beast is made to work very hard by hisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.master. The ass does not really know fo r whom he works so hard day and night.
He remains satisfied by filling his stomac h with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a
while under fear of being beaten by his master , and satisfying his sex appetite
at the risk of being repeatedly kicked  by the opposite party. The ass sings
poetry and philosophy sometimes, but th is braying sound only disturbs others.
This is the position of the foolis h fruitive worker who does not kno w for whom
he should work. He does not know that karma  (action) is meant for yajïa
(sacrifice).
Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of
self-created duties say that they have no  time to hear of the immortality of the
living being. To such müòhas,  material gains, which are destructible, are life’s
all in all—despite t he fact that the müòhas  enjoy only a very small fraction of
the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive
gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with
practically no food; they are simply  absorbed in working hard day and night for
the benefit of illusory masters. Ignora nt of their real master, the foolish
workers waste their valuable time serv ing mammon. Unfortunately, they never
surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of
Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to
accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will
untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering
mund ane world, but will have very little ti me to hear about the eternal living
force that moves the material world.
(2) Another class of duñkåté,  or miscreant, is called the narädhama,  or the
lowest of mankind. Nara  means human being, and adhama  means the lowest.
Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000
human species. Out of these there  are numerous lower forms of human life
that are mostly uncivilized. The civi lized human beings are those who have
regulative principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are
socially and politically developed but who have no religious pri nciples must be
considered narädhamas.  Nor is religion without God religion, because the
purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and
man’s relation with Him. In the Gétä the Personality of Godhead clearly statesCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.that there is  no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The
civilized form of human life is meant for man’s reviving the lost consciousness  of
his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead Çré
Kåñëa, who is all-powerful. Whoever  loses this chance is classified as a
narädhama.  We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is
in the mother’s womb (an extremely un comfortable situation) he prays to God
for deliverance and promises to wo rship Him alone as soon as he g ets out. To
pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being
because he is eternally related with Go d. But after his deliverance, the child
forgets the difficulties of birth and forg ets his deliverer also, being influenced
by mäyä,  the illusory energy.
It is the duty of the guardians of chil dren to revive the divine consciousness
dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in
the Manu-småti.  which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for
reviving God consciousness  in the system of varëäçrama.  However, no process
is strictly followed now in any part of  the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of
the population is narädhama.
When the whole population becomes narädhama.  naturally all their
so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of
physical nature. According to the standard of the Gétä,  a learned man is he
who sees on equal terms the learned brähmaë a. the dog. the cow, the elephant
and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. Çré Nityänanda Prabhu,
who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical
narädhamas.  the brothers Jagäi and Mädh äi, and showed how the mercy of a
real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the narädhama  who is
condemned by the Personality of Godh ead can again revive his spiritual
consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.
Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in propagating the bhägavata-dharma,  or
activities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the
message of the Personality of Godhea d. The essence of this message is
Bhagavad-gétä.  The lowest amongst human bei ngs can be delivered by this
submissive hearing process only, but unfo rtunately they even refuse to give an
aural reception to these messages, and wh at to speak of surrendering to the willCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.of the Supreme Lord? Narädhamas,  or the lowest of mankind, will ful ly neglect
the prime duty of the human being.
(3) The next class of duñkåté  is called mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù,  or those persons
whose erudite knowledge has been nulli fied by the influence of illusory
material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows—great philosophers,
poets, literati, scientists, etc .—but the illusory energy misguides them, and
therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.
There are a great number of mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù  at the present moment,
even amongst the scholars of the Bhagavad-gétä.  In the Gétä,  in plain and
simple language, it is stated that Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. There is none equal to or g reater than Him. He is mentioned as the
father of Brahmä, the original father of all human beings. In fact, Çré Kåñëa is
said to be not only the father of Brahmä but also the father of all species of life.
He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Param ätmä; the Supersoul in
every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and
everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear
statements, the mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù  deride the personality of the Supreme
Lord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that
the blessed form of human life is desi gned after the eternal and transcendental
feature of the Supreme Lord.
All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gétä by the class of
mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù,  outside the purview of the paramparä  system, are so
many stumbling blocks on the path of  spiritual understanding. The deluded
interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus  feet of Çré Kåñëa, nor do they
teach others to follow this principle.
(4) The last class of duñkåté  is called äsuraà bhävam äçritäù,  or those of
demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the
Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable
to give any tangible rea sons as to why not. There are others who make Him
subordinate to the impersonal feature, al though the opposite is declared in the
Gétä.  Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present
a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in  the factory of his brain. Such
persons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa.
Çré Yämunäcärya Albandaru of South India said, “O my Lord! You are
unknowable to persons involved with  atheistic principles, despite Your
uncommon qualities, features and activities, despite Your personality’s being
confirmed by all the revealed scriptures  in the quality of goodness, and despite
Your being acknowledged by the famous  authorities renowned for their depth
of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly
qualities.”
Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons,  (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the
deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never
surrender unto the lotus feet of the Pe rsonality of Godhead in spite of all
scriptural and authoritati ve advice.

O best among the Bhäratas, four kinds of pious men begin to renderCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.devotional service unto Me—the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the
inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.
PURPORT
Unlike the miscreants, these are adhere nts of the regulative principles of
the scriptures, and they are called sukåtinaù,  or those who obey the rules and
regulations of scriptures, the moral an d social laws, and are, more or less,
devoted to the Supreme Lo rd. Out of these there are four classes of
men—those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money,
those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching
after knowledge of the Absolute Tr uth. These persons come to the S upreme
Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure
devotees, because they have some aspi ration to fulfill in exchange for
devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without
desire for material profi t. The Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.1.11 ) defines pure
devotion thus:
anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà
jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam
änukülyena kåñëänu-
çélanaà bhaktir uttamä
 [Madhya 19.167 ]
“One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord
Kåñëa favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive
activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.”
When these four kinds of persons come  to the Supreme Lord for devotional
service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they
also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them
devotional service is very d ifficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and
without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in
contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.
Those who are always busy with fruiti ve activities come to the Lord inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in
their distress, devotees of the Lord. Th ose who are simply frustrated also come
sometimes to associate wit h the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know
about God. Similarly, when the dry philos ophers are frustrated in every field of
knowledge, they sometimes want to le arn of God, and they come to the
Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus tran scend knowledge of
the impersonal Brahman and the loca lized Paramätmä and come to the
personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure
devotee. On the whole, when the dist ressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of
knowledge, and tho se who are in need of money are free from all material
desires, and when they fully understa nd that material remuneration has
nothing to do with spiritual improvemen t, they become pure devotees. As long
as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in  transcendental service to
the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, the search for mundane
knowledge, etc. So one has to transcen d all this before one can come to the
stage of pure devotional service.

PURPORT
Free from all contaminations of mate rial desires, the distressed, the
inquisitive, the penniless and the seeker after supreme knowledge can all
become pure devotees. But out of th em, he who is in knowledge of the
Absolute Truth and free from all material d esires becomes a really pure
devotee of the Lord. And of the four  orders, the devotee who is in full
knowledge and is at the same time enga ged in devotional service is, the Lord
says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizes that his self is
different from his material body, and wh en further advanced he comes to the
knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Pa ramätmä. When one is fully purified,
he realizes that his constitutional positi on is to be the eternal servant of God.
So by association with pur e devotees the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker
after material amelioration and the ma n in knowledge all become themselves
pure. But in the preparatory stage, th e man who is in full knowledge of the
Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing dev otional service is very dear
to the Lord. He who is situated in pure  knowledge of the transcendence of the
Supreme Personality of God is so protec ted in devotional service that material
contamination cannot touch him.

PURPORT
It is not that devotees who are less complete in knowledge are not dear to
the Lord. The Lord says that all are magnanimous because anyone who comes
to the Lord for any purpose is called a mahätmä,  or great soul. The devotees
who want some benefit out of d evotional service are accepted by the Lord
because there is an exchange of affect ion. Out of affection they ask the Lord
for some material benefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that
they also advance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge is
considered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is to serve the
Supreme Lord with love and devotion . Such a devotee cannot live a second
without contacting or serving the Supr eme Lord. Similarly, the Supreme Lord
is ver y fond of His devotee and cannot be separated from him.
In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (9.4.68 ), the Lord says:

pure devotees. Pure devotees i n full knowledge are never out of spiritual touch,
and therefore they are very much dear to Me.”

The living entity, while executing de votional service or transcendental
rituals after many, many births, may actually become situated in
transcendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In  the beginning of spiritual
realization, while one is trying to gi ve up one’s attachment to materialism,
there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further
advanced he can understand that there ar e activities in the spiritual life and
that these activities constitute devotional  service. Realizing this, he becomes
attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At
such a time one can understand that Lord Çré Kåñëa’s mercy is everything, that
He is the cause of all caus es and that this material manifestation is not
independent from Him. He realizes th e material world to be a perverted
reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a
relationship with the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. Thus he thinks  of everything in
relation to Väsudeva, or Çré Kåñëa. Such a universal vision of Väsudeva
precipitates one’s full surrender to the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa as the highest
goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.
This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and 15)
of the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad:
sahasra-çérñä puruñaù

In the Chändogya Upaniñad  (5.1.15 ) it is said, na vai väco na cakñüàñi na
çroträëi na manäàséty äcakñate präëa iti eväcakñate präëo hy evaitäni sarväëiCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.bhavanti:  “In the body of a living being ne ither the power to speak, nor the
power to see, nor the power  to hear, nor the power to think is the prime factor;
it is life which is the center of all ac tivities.” Similarly Lord Väsudeva, or the
Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa,  is the prime entity in everything. In
this body there are powers of speaking, o f seeing, of hearing, of mental
activities, etc. But these are not import ant if not related to the Supreme Lord.
And because Väsudeva is all-pervadin g and everything is Väsudeva, the
devotee surrenders in full knowledge (cf. Bhagavad-gétä  7.17 and 11.40 ).

Less intelligent people who have lost their spiritual sense take shelter of
demigods for immediate fulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people
do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in the
lower modes of nature (ignor ance and passion) and therefore worship various
demigods. Following the rules and regula tions of worship, they are satisfied.
The worshipers of demigods are motiva ted by small desires and do not know
how to reach the supreme goal , but a devotee of the Supr eme Lord is not
misguided. Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for
worshiping different gods for differe nt purposes (e.g., a diseased man is
recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord
think that for certain pu rposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord.
But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord Kåñëa is the master of all. In
the Caitanya-caritämåta  (Ädi 5.142 ) it is said, ekale éçvara kåñëa, ära saba
bhåtya:  only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kå ñëa, is master, and all
others are servants. Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for
satisfaction of his material needs. He  depends on the Supreme Lord. And the
pure devotee is satisfied with whatever He gives.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  21

I am in everyone’s heart as the Supersou l. As soon as one desires to worship

PURPORT
God has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to
have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from
the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone’s heart,
understands and gives facilit ies to such persons. As the supreme father of all
living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all
facilities so that they can fulfill thei r material desires. Some may ask why the
all-powerful God gives facilities to the living  entities for enjoying this material
world and so lets them fall into the trap  of the illusory energy. The answer is
that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul do es not give such facilities, then thereCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full
independence—whatever one likes—but His ultimate instruction we find in
the Bhagavad-gétä:  one should give up all other engagements and fully
surrender unto Him . That will make man happy.
Both the living entity and the demigo ds are subordinate to the will of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship
the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction
without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the
will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are
distressed in the material world go to th e demigods, as they are advised in the
Vedic literature. A person wanting some particular thing may worship such
and such a demigod. For example, a diseased person is recommended to
worship the sun-god; a person wantin g education may worship the goddess of
learning, Sarasvaté; and a person want ing a beautiful wife may worship the
goddess Umä, the wif e of Lord Çiva. In this way there are recommendations in
the çästras  (Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different
demigods. And because a particular livi ng entity wants to enjoy a particular
material facility, the Lord inspires him with a  strong desire to achieve that
benediction from that particular demigo d, and so he successfully receives the
benediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living
entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Suprem e
Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living  entities with such an affinity, but
because He is the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts
of all living entities, Kåñëa gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods.
The demigods are  actually different parts of th e universal body of the Supreme
Lord; therefore they have no independence . In the Vedic literature it is stated:
“The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the
heart of the demigod; therefore He a rranges through the demigod to fulfill the
desire of the living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are
dependent on the supreme will. They are not independent.”

Endowed with such a faith, he endeavors to worship a particular demigod

PURPORT
The demigods cannot award benedictio ns to their devotees without the
permission of the Supreme Lord. The livi ng entity may forget that everything
is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the
worship of demigods and achievemen t of desired results are due not to the
demigods but to the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead, by arrangement. The
less intelligent living entity does not kn ow this, and therefore he foolishly goes
to the demigods for some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of
something, prays only to the Suprem e Lord. Asking for material benefit,
however, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods
usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something
undue is desired by  the living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.desire. In the Caitanya-caritämåta  it is said that one who worships the Supreme
Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his
desires . Devotional service to the Sup reme Lord and the worship of a demigod
cannot be on the same platform, because worship of a demigod is material and
devotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual.
For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are
impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord  is therefore not awarded the material
benefits desired by less intelligent living entities, who therefore prefer to
worship demigods of the  material world rather than engage in the devotional
service of the Supreme Lord.

Some commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä  say that one who worships a
demigod can reach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the
worshipers of demigods go to the di fferent planetary systems where various
demigods are situated, just as a worshi per of the sun achieves the sun or a
worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone
wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god’s
planet. It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped,
will reach the Supreme Personality of Godh ead. That is denied here, for it is
clearly stated that the worshipers of de migods go to different planets in the
material world but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the
supreme planet of  the Personality of Godhead.
Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the
body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by
worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent
because they don’t know to what part of  the body food must be supplied. Some
of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways
to supply food. This isn’t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body
through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods  are different
parts of the universal body of the Su preme Lord, and in their ignorance they
believe that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the
Supreme Lord.
Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living
entities are also. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is stated that the brähmaëas  are
the head of the Supreme Lord, the kñatriyas  are His arms, the vaiçyas  are His
waist, the çüdras  are His leg s, and all serve different functions. Regardless of
the situation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part and
parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not
understand this, he achieves different planets where th e demigods reside. This
is not the same destination the devotee reaches.
The results achieved by the demigods’ benedictions are perishable because
within this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers areCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results
achieved by worshiping dem igods are perishable, and therefore such worship is
performed by the less intelligent livi ng entity. Because the pure devotee
engaged in Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord
achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowl edge, his achievements
and those of the common worshiper of  the demigods are different. The
Supreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited.
Therefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.

Unintelligent men, who do not know Me perfectly, think that I, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa,  was impersonal before and have now
assumed this personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My
higher nature, which is imperishable an d supreme.
PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less
intelligent persons, and here the impers onalists are similarly described. Lord
Kåñëa in His personal form is here sp eaking before Arjuna, and still, due to
ignorance, impersonalists argue tha t the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form.
Yämunäcärya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession of
Rämänujäcärya, has written two very appropriate verses in this connection.
He says,
tväà çéla-rüpa-caritaiù parama-prakåñöaiù
sattvena sättvikatayä prabalaiç ca çästraiù
prakhyäta-daiva-paramärtha-vidäà mataiç ca

“My dear Lord, devotees like Vyäsad eva and Närada know You to be the
Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can
come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can
thus understand that You are th e Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those
who are in the modes of passion and ig norance, the demons, the nondevotees,
cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert
such nondevotees may be in discussing Vedänta  and the Upaniñads  and other
Vedic literatures, it is not possible fo r them to understand the Personality of
Godhead.” ( Stotra-ratna  12)
In the Brahma-saàhitä  it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot
be understood simply by study of the Vedänta  literature. Only by the mercy of
the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in
this verse it is clearly stat ed that not only are the worshipers of the demigods
less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Vedänta  and
speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true Kåñëa consciousness
are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possi ble to understand God’s
personal nature. Persons who are unde r the impression that the Absolute
Truth is impersonal are described as abuddhayaù,  which means those who do
not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is st ated that supreme realization begins from the
impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul—but theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern
impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even fol low their great
predecessor Çaìkaräcärya, who has spec ifically stated that Kåñëa is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impers onalists, therefore, not knowing the
Supreme Truth, think Kåñëa to be only the son of Devaké and Vasudeva, or a
prince, or a power ful living entity. This is also condemned in the
Bhagavad-gétä  (9.11). Avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam:  “Only
the fools regard Me as an ordinary person.”
The fact is that no one can understa nd Kåñëa without rendering devotional
service and without developing Kåñëa consciousness. The Bhägavatam
(10.14.29 ) confirms this:
athäpi te deva padämbuja-dvaya-
prasäda-leçänugåhéta eva hi
jänäti tattvaà bhagavan-mahimno
na cänya eko ’pi ciraà vicinvan
“My Lord, if one is favored by even a sl ight trace of the mercy of Your lotus
feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who
speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to
know You, even though they conti nue to study the Vedas  for many years.” One
cannot understand the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead, Kåñëa, or His form,
quality or name simply by mental specul ation or by discussing Vedic literature.
One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is  fully engaged in
Kåñëa consciousness, beginning by chanting the mahä-mantra —Hare Kåñëa,
Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma,
Hare Hare—then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalis ts think that Kåñëa has a body made of this
material nature and that all His acti vities, His form and everything are mäyä.
These impersonalists are known as Mäyä vädés. They do not know the ultimate
truth.
The twentieth verse clearly states, kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù prapadyante
’nya-devatäù.  “Those who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the
different demigods.” It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Godhead, there are demigods wh o have their different planets, and the Lord
also has a planet. As stated in the twenty-third verse, devän deva-yajo yänti
mad-bhaktä yänti mäm api : the worshipers of the demigods go to the different
planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of L ord Kåñëa go to the
Kåñëaloka planet. Although this is cl early stated, the foolish impersonalists
still maintain that the Lord is formle ss and that these forms are impositions.
From the study of the Gétä does it appear that the demigods and their abodes
are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor Kåñëa, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord Kåñëa is
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the
demigods have theirs.
Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that
f o r m  i s  i m p o s e d  d o e s  n o t  h o l d  t r u e .  I t  is clearly stated here that it is not
imposed. From the Bhagavad-gétä  we can clearly understand that the forms of
the demigods and the form of  the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing
and that Lord Kåñëa is sac-cid-änanda,  eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedas
also confirm that the Supreme Absolute Truth is änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät,  or by
nature full of blissful pleasure, and that He is the rese rvoir of unlimited
auspicious qualities. And in the Gétä the Lord says that although He is aja
(unborn), He still appears. These are th e facts that we should understand from
the Bhagavad-gétä.  We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of
Godhead can  be impersonal; the imposition th eory of the impersonalist monist
is false as far as the statements of the Gétä are concerned. It is clear herein that
the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa, has both form and personality.

PURPORT
It may be argued that since Kåñëa was present on this earth and was visible
to everyone, then why isn’t He manifest to everyone now? But actually He was
not manifest to everyone. When Kåñë a was present there were only a few
people who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
In the assembly of Kurus, when Çiçupä la spoke against Kåñëa’s being elected
president of the assembly, Bhéñma su pported Him and proclaimed Him to be
the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pä ëòavas and a few others knew th at He was
the Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and
the common man. Therefore in the Bhagavad-gétä  Kåñëa says that but for His
pure devotees, all men consider Him to  be like themselves. He was manifest
only to His devotees a s the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to
unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His internal potency.
In the prayers of Kunté in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.8.19 ) it is said that the
Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-mäyä  and thus ordinary people cannot
understand Him. This yoga-mäyä  curtain is also confirmed in the Éçopaniñad
(mantra  15), in which the d evotee prays:
hiraëmayena pätreëaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.satyasyäpihitaà mukham
tat tvaà püñann apävåëu
satya-dharmäya dåñöaye
“O my Lord, You are the maintainer of  the entire universe, and devotional
service to You is the highest religious pr inciple. Therefore, I pray that You will
also maintain me. Your transcen dental form is covered by the yoga-mäyä.  The
brahmajyoti  is the cove ring of the internal potency. May You kindly remove
this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-änanda-vigraha
[Bs. 5.1], Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge.” The Supreme Personality
of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by
the internal potency of the brahmajyoti,  and the less intelligent impersonalists
cannot see the Supreme on this account.
Also in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.14.7 ) there is this prayer by Brahmä: “O
Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Supe rsoul, O master of all mystery, who
can calculate Your potency and pastim es in this world? You are always
expanding Your internal potency, and therefore no one can understand You.
Learned scientists and learned scholars can examine the atomic constitution
of the material world or even the planets,  but still they are unable to calculate
Your energy and potency, although You are present before them .” The
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, is not only unborn but also
avyaya,  inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and His
energies are all inexhaustible.

PURPORT
Here the question of personality an d impersonality is clearly stated. If
Kåñëa, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were mäyä,  material,
as the impersonalists consider Him to be , then like the living entity He would
change His body and forget e verything about His past life. Anyone with a
material body cannot remember his past li fe, nor can he foretell his future life,
nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know
what is happening in past, present and future. Unles s one is liberated from
material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.
Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Kåñëa clearly says that He
completely knows what happened in th e past, what is happening in the
present, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have
seen that Lord Kåñëa remembers instructing Viva svän, the sun-god, millions of
years ago. Kåñëa knows every living entity because He is situated in every
living being’s heart as the Supersoul. But despite His presence in every living
entity as Supersoul and His presence  as the Supreme Personality of God head,
the less intelligent, even if able to realize the impersonal Brahman, cannot
realize Çré Kåñëa as the Supreme Person . Certainly the transcendental body of
Çré Kåñëa is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and mäyä  is like a cloud. In
the material  world we can see that there is the sun and that there are cloudsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.and different stars and planets. The cl ouds may cover all these in the sky
temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun,
moon and stars are not actually cov ered. Similarly, mäyä  cannot cover the
Supreme Lord. By His internal potenc y He is not manifest to the less
intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter , out of
millions and millions of men, some  try to become perfect in thi s human form
of life, and out of thousands and thousa nds of such perfected men, hardly one
can understand what Lord Kåñëa is. Even  if one is perfected by realization of
impersonal Brahman or localized Paramätmä, he cannot possibly understand
the Supreme Pe rsonality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, without being in Kåñëa
consciousness.

The real constitutional position of the living entity is that of subordination
to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one is deluded into
separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlled by illusory energy
and cannot understand the Supr eme Personality of Godhead. The illusory
energy is manifested in the duality of desire and hate. Due to desire and hate,
the ignorant person wants to become one with the Supreme Lord and envies
Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pure devotees, wh o are not
deluded or contaminated by desire an d hate, can understand that Lord Çré
Kåñëa appears by His internal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality

material energies. Th is is their misfortune. Such deluded persons,
symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery and
happiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc., thinking,
“This is my wife; this is my hous e; I am the master of this house ; I am the
husband of this wife.” These are the dualities of delusion. Those who are so
deluded by dualities are completely foolish and therefore cannot understand
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Persons who have acted piously in previo us lives and in this life and whose
sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion,
and they engage themselves in My service with determination.
PURPORT
Those eligible for elevation to the tr anscendental position are mentioned in
this verse. For those who are sinful, athe istic, foolish and deceitful, it is very
difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who have
passed their lives in  practicing the regulative principles of religion, who have
acted piously and who have conquered si nful reactions can accept devotional
service and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Then, gradually, they can medita te in trance on the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. That is the proc ess of being situated on the spiritual
platform. This elevation is possible in Kåñëa consciousness in the association of
pure devotees, for in the association of great devotees one can be delivered
from delusion.
It is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (5.5.2 ) that if one actually wants to be
liberated he must render service to the devotees ( mahat-seväà dväram ähur
vimukteù ); but one who associates with ma terialistic people is on the path
leading to the darkest regio n of existence ( tamo-dväraà yoñitäà saìgi-saìgam ).
All the devotees of the Lord traverse this earth just to recover the conditioned
souls from their delusion. The impersonalis ts do not know that forgetting their
constitutional position as subordinate to th e Supreme Lord is the greatest
violation of God’s law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutional
position, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality or to be fully
engaged in His transcendental loving service with determination.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  29

Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death
take refuge in Me in devotional servic e. They are actually Brahman because
they entirely know everything about transcendental activities.
PURPORT
Birth, death, old age and diseases a ffect this material body, but not the
spiritual body. There is no birth, deat h, old age and disease for the spiritual
body, so one who attains a spiritual body , becomes one of the associates of the
Supreme Personality of  Godhead and engages in eternal devotional service is
really liberated. Ahaà brahmäsmi:  I am spirit. It is said that one should
understand that he is Brahman, spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is
also in devotional service, as described in this verse. The pure devotees areCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.transcendentally situated on the Brah man platform, and they know everything
about transcendental activities.
Four kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the
transcendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, and by the
grace of the Supreme Lord, when they ar e fully Kåñëa conscious, they actually
enjoy spiritual association with the Supr eme Lord. But those who are
worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord in His supreme planet.
Even the less intelligent Brahman-real ized persons cannot reach the supreme
planet of Kåñëa known as Goloka Vå ndävana. Only persons who perform
activitie s in Kåñëa consciousness ( mäm äçritya ) are actually entitled to be
called Brahman, because they are actually endeavoring to reach the Kåñëa
planet. Such persons have no misgivin gs about Kåñëa, and thus they are
factually Brahman.
Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arcä of the Lord, or who
are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation from material
bondage, also know, by the grace of  the Lord, the purports of Brahman,
adhibhüta,  etc., as explained by the L ord in the next chapter.

Those in full consciousness of Me, who know Me, the Supreme Lord, to be
the governing principle of the material ma nifestation, of the demigods, and of all
methods of sacrifice, can understand and know Me, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, even at the tim e of death.
PURPORT
Persons acting in Kåñëa consciousness are never deviated from the path of
entirely understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the
transcendental association of Kåñëa co nsciousness, one can understand how
the Supreme Lord is the governing principl e of the material manifestation and
even of the demigods. Gradually, by su ch transcendental association, one
becomes convinced of the Supreme Person ality of Godhead, and at the time of
death such a Kåñëa conscious person can never forget Kåñëa. Naturally h e is
thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Våndävana.
This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully
Kåñëa conscious person. The beginning of  Kåñëa consciousness is association
of persons who are Kåñëa conscious. Such  association is spiritual and puts one
directly in touch with the Supr eme Lord, and, by His grace, one can
understand Kåñëa to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the same
time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity
and how the living entity forgets Kåñëa and becomes entangled in mat erial
activities. By gradual development of Kåñëa consciousness in good association,
the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of Kåñëa he has
become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand
that this human form o f life is an opportunity to regain Kåñëa consciousness
and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme
Lord.
Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.inquisitive man, the man in want of  material necessities, knowledge of
Brahman, knowledge of Paramätmä, liberation from birth, death and diseases,
and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in
Kåñëa consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply
directly engages himself in activities  of Kåñëa consciousness and thereby
factually attains his constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Lord
Kåñëa. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the
Supreme Lord in pure devotional service.  He is convinced that by his doing so,
all his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called dåòha-vrata,
and it is t he beginning of bhakti-yoga,  or transcendental loving service. That is
the verdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä  is the
substance of that conviction.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute.

Arjuna inquired: O my Lord, O Supreme Person, what is Brahman? What is

what are the demigods? Please explain this to me.
PURPORT
In this chapter Lord Kåñëa answers different questions from Arjuna,
beginning with “What is Brahman?” The Lord also explains karma  (fruitive
activities), devotional service and yoga principles, and devotional service in its
pure form. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam  explains that the Supreme Absolute Truth
is known as Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhag avän. In addition, the living entity,
the individual soul, is also called Brahman. Arjuna also inquires about ätmä,
which refers to body, soul and mind. According to the Vedic  dictionary, ätmä
refers to the mind, soul, body and senses also.
Arjuna has addressed the Supreme Lord as Puruñottama, Supreme Person,
which means that he was putting these qu estions not simply to a friend but to
the Supreme Person, knowing Him to be  the supreme authority able to give
definitive answers.

TRANSLATION
Who is the Lord of sacrifice, and how does He live in the body, O
Madhusüdana? And how can those engaged  in devotional service know You at
the time of death?
PURPORT
“Lord of sacrifice” may refer to either Indra or Viñëu. Viñëu is the chief of
the primal demigods, including Brahmä an d Çiva, and Indra is the chief of the
administrative demigods. Both Indra and Viñëu are worshiped by yajïa
performances. But here Arjuna a sks who is actually the Lord of yajïa
(sacrifice) and how the Lord is residing within the body of the living entity.
Arjuna addresses the Lord as Madhusüdana because Kåñëa once killed a
demon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of
doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna, because Arjuna is a
Kåñëa conscious devotee. Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since Kåñëa
is so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhusüdana soCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.that Kåñëa might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna’s mind.
Now the word prayäëa-käle  in this verse is very significant because
whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna is very
anxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in Kåñëa consciousness.
What should be their position at that  final moment? At the time of death all
the bodily functions are disrupted, and the mind is not in a proper condition.
Thus disturbed by the bodily situation,  one may not be able to remember the
Supreme Lord. Mahäräja Kulaçekhara, a great devotee, prays, “ My dear Lord,
just now I am quite healthy, and it is better that I die immediately so that the
swan of my mind can seek entrance at  the stem of Your lotus feet.” The
metaphor is used because the swan, a bird of the water, takes pleasure in
digging into the  lotus flowers; its sporting proclivity is to enter the lotus flower.
Mahäräja Kulaçekhara says to the Lord , “Now my mind is undisturbed, and I
am quite healthy. If I die immediately, thinking of Your lotus feet, then I am
sure that my performance of Your devotional service will become perfect. But
if I have to wait for my natural deat h, then I do not know what will happen,
because at that time the bodily functi ons will be disrupted, my throat will be
choked up, and I do not know whether I shall be able to chant Your name.
Better let me die immediately.” Arjuna  questions how a person can fix his
mind on Kåñëa’s lotus feet at such a time.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The indestructible,
transcendental living entity is called Brahman, and his eternal nature is called
adhyätma, the self. Action pertaining to the development of the material bodies
of the living entities is called k arma, or fruitive activities.
PURPORT
Brahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not
changed at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Parabrahman. Brahman
refers to the living entity, and Parabrahman refers to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. The constitutiona l position of the living entity is different from
the position he takes in the material world. In material consciousness his
nature is to try to be the lord of ma tter, but in spiritual consciousness, Kåñëa
consciousness, his position is to serve the Suprem e. When the living entity is
in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material
world. That is called karma,  or varied creation by the force of material
consciousness.
In Vedic literature the living entity is called jévätmä  and Brahman, but he is
never called Parabrahman. The living entity ( jévätmä ) takes different
positions—sometimes he merges into th e dark material nature and identifies
himself with matter, and sometim es he identifies himself with the superior,
spiritual nature. Therefore he is calle d the Supreme Lord’s marginal energy.
According to his identification with mate rial or spiritual nature, he receives aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of
the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spir itual nature he has only one body. In
material nature he is manifested some times as a man, demigod, animal, beast,
bird, etc., according to his karma.  To attain material heavenly planets and
enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices ( yajïa ), but when his
merit is exhausted he returns to earth ag ain in the form of a man. This process
is called karma.
The Chändogya Upaniñad  describes the Vedic sacrificial process. On the
sacrificial altar, five kinds of offerings ar e made into five kinds of fire. The five
kinds of fire are conceived of as the he avenly planets, clouds, the earth, man
and woman, and the f ive kinds of sacrificial offerings are faith, the enjoyer on
the moon, rain, grains and semen.
In the process of sacrifice, the living  entity makes specific sacrifices to
attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the
merit of sacrifice is exhausted, the livi ng entity descends to earth in the form
of rain, then takes on the  form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and
transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living
entity once again attains the human fo rm to perform sacrifice and so repeat
the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetual ly comes and goes on the
material path. The Kåñëa conscious pers on, however, avoids such sacrifices. He
takes directly to Kåñëa consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to
Godhead.
Impersonalist commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä  unreasonably assume
that Brahman takes the form of jéva in the material world, and to substantiate
this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7,  of the Gétä.  But in this verse the
Lord also speaks of the livin g entity as “an eternal fragment of Myself.” The
fragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but
the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that
the Supreme Brahman assumes the form of jéva is not a cceptable. It is
important to remember that in Vedic li terature Brahman (the living entity) is
distinguished from Parabrahman (the Supreme Lord).

TRANSLATION
O best of the embodied beings, the physical nature, which is constantly
changing, is called adhibhüta [the material manifestation]. The universal form
of the Lord, which includes all the demi gods, like those of the sun and moon, is
called adhidaiva. And I,  the Supreme Lord, represented as the Supersoul in the
heart of every embodied being, am called adhiyajïa [the Lord of sacrifice].
PURPORT
The physical nature is constantly ch anging. Material bodies generally pass
through six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration,
they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This
physical nature is called adhibh üta. It is created at a certain point and will be
annihilated at a certain point. The conc eption of the universal form of the
Supreme Lord, which includes all the demigods and their different planets, is
called adhidaivata.  And present in the body along wi th the individual soul isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the Supersoul, a plenary representation of Lord Kåñëa. The Supersoul is called
the Paramätmä or adhiyajïa  and is situated in the heart. The word eva is
particularly important in the context of  this verse because by this word the
Lord stresses that the Paramätmä is no t different from Him. The Supersoul,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seat ed beside the individual soul, is the
witness of the individual soul’s activities  and is the source of the soul’s various
types of consciousne ss. The Supersoul gives the individual soul an opportunity
to act freely and witnesses his activiti es. The functions of all these different
manifestations of the Supreme Lord au tomatically become clarified for the
pure Kåñëa conscious devotee engaged in tr anscendental service to the Lord.
The gigantic universal form of the Lord called adhidaivata  is contemplated by
the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as
Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form, or
viräö-puruña,  whose legs are considered the lower planets, whose eyes are
considered the sun and moon, and wh ose head is considered the upper
planetary system.

And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body, remembering Me alone,
at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.
PURPORT
In this verse the importance of Kå ñëa consciousness is stressed. Anyone
who quits his body in Kåñëa consciousness is at once transferred to the
transcendental nature of the Supreme Lo rd. The Supreme Lord is the purest of
the pure. Therefore anyone who is c onstantly Kåñëa conscious is also the
purest of the pure. The word smaran  (“remembering”) is important.
Remembrance of Kåñëa is not possible for the impure soul who has not
practiced Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service. Therefore one should
practice Kåñëa consciousness from the very beginning of life. If one wants to
achieve success at the end of his life , the process of remembering Kåñëa is
essential. Therefore one should constantly, incessantly chant the
mahä-mantra —Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñ ëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,
Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Lord  Caitanya has advised that one be as
tolerant as a tree ( taror iva sahiñëunä ). There may be so many impediments for
a person who is chanting Hare Kåñëa. Nonetheless, tolerating all these
impedi ments, one should continue to chan t Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa
Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, so that at
the end of one’s life one can have the full benefit of Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of
Kunté, that state he will attain without fail.
PURPORT
The process of changing one’s nature at the critical moment of death is
here explained. A person who at the end of his life quits his body thinking of
Kåñëa attains the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, but it is not true
that a person who thinks of something other than Kåñëa attains the same
transcendental state. This is a point we should note very carefully. How can
one die in the proper state of mind? Mahäräja Bharata, although a great
personality, thought of a deer at the end of his life, and s o in his next life he
was transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his
past activities, he had to accept that  animal body. Of course, one’s thoughts
during the course of one’s life accumula te to influence one’s thoughts at the
moment of death, so this life creates one’ s next life. If in one’s present life one
lives in the mode of goodness and always thinks of Kåñëa, it is possible for one
to remember Kåñëa at the end of one’s li fe. That will help one be transferred to
the transc endental nature of Kåñëa. If one is transcendentally absorbed in
Kåñëa’s service, then his next body wi ll be transcendental (spiritual), not
material. Therefore the chanting of Ha re Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa,
Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma , Hare Hare is the best process
for successfully changing one’s state of being at the end of one’s life.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  7

TRANSLATION
He who meditates on Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind
constantly engaged in remembering Me , undeviated from the path, he, O
Pärtha, is sure to reach Me.
PURPORT
In this verse Lord Kåñëa stresses the importance of remembering Him.
One’s memory of Kåñëa is revived by chanting the mahä-mantra,  Hare Kåñëa.
By this practice of chanting and hear ing the sound vibration of the Supreme
Lord, one’s ear, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very
easy to practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. Puruñam  means
enjoyer. Although living entities belo ng to the marginal energy of the
Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination. They think themselvesCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.enjoyers, but they are not the supreme en joyer. Here it is clearly stated that
the supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Pe rsonality of Godhead in His different
manifestations and plenary expansions as Näräyaëa, Väsudeva, etc.
The devotee can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme
Lord, in any of His features—Näräyaëa,  Kåñëa, Räma, etc.—by chanting Hare
Kåñëa. This practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his
constant chanting, he will be tran sferred to the kingdom of God. Yoga  practice
is meditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare Kåñëa one
fixes his mind always on the Supreme Lo rd. The mind is fickle, and therefore
it is necessary to engage the mind by force to think of K åñëa. One example
often given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so
is transformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly
think of Kåñëa, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the s ame
bodily constitution as Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
One should meditate upon the Supr eme Person as the one who knows
everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than
the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material
conception, who is inconceivable,  and who is always a person. He is luminous
like the sun, and He is transcende ntal, beyond this material nature.
PURPORT
The process of thinking of the Suprem e is mentioned in this verse. The
foremost point is that He is not impe rsonal or void. One cannot meditate on
something impersonal or void. That is ve ry difficult. The process of thinking of
Kåñëa, however, is very easy  and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord
is puruña,  a person—we think of the person Räma and the person Kåñëa. And
whether one thinks of Räma or of Kåñëa, what He is like is described in this
verse of Bhagavad-gétä.  The Lord is kavi;  that is , He knows past, present and
future and therefore knows everything.  He is the oldest personality because He
is the origin of everything; everything i s  b o r n  o u t  o f  H i m .  H e  i s  a l s o  t h e
supreme controller of the universe, an d He is the maintainer and instruct or of
humanity. He is smaller than the sm allest. The living entity is one
ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hai r, but the Lord is so inconceivably small
that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller
than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the
heart of the smallest and control him as  the Supersoul. Although so small, He
is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary
systems are sustained. We often wonder how t hese big planets are floating in
the air. It is stated here that the Supr eme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is
sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya
(“inconceivable”) is very signific ant in this connection. God’s en ergy is
beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is thereforeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.called inconceivable ( acintya ). Who can argue this point? He pervades this
material world and yet is beyond it. We  cannot comprehend even this material
world, which is insign ificant compared to the spiritual world—so how can we
comprehend what is beyond? Acintya  means that which is beyond this material
world, that which our argument, logi c and philosophical speculation cannot
touch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intel ligent persons, avoiding
useless argument and speculation, should  accept what is stated in scriptures
like the Vedas, Bhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam  and follow the
principles they set down. This will lead one to understanding.

TRANSLATIONCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and,
by the strength of yoga, with an undeviating mind, engages himself in
remembering the Supreme Lord in full devotion, will certainly attain to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
In this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must be
fixed in devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those practiced
in yoga,  it is recommended that they rais e the life force between the eyebrows
(to the äjïä-cakra ). The practice of ñaö-cakra-yoga,  involving meditation on
the six cakras,  is suggested here. A pure devotee does not practice such yoga,
but because he is always engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, at death he can
remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead by Hi s grace. This is explained
in verse fourteen.
The particular use of the word yoga-balena  is significant in this verse
because without practice of yoga—whether ñaö-cakra-yoga  or bhakti-yoga —one
cannot come to this transcendental stat e of being at the time of death. One
cannot suddenly remember the Supr eme Lord at death; one must have
practiced some yoga system, especially the system of bhakti-yoga.  Since one’s
mind at death is very disturbed, one should practice transcendence through
yoga during one’s life.

TRANSLATION
Persons who are learned in the Vedas,  who utter oàkära and who are great
sages in the renounced order enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one
practices celibacy. I shall now briefly explain to you this process by which one
may attain salvation.
PURPORT
Lord Çré Kåñëa has recommended to Arjuna the practice of ñaö-cakra-yoga,
in which one places the air of life betw een the eyebrows. Taking it for granted
that Arjuna might not know how to practice ñaö-cakra-yoga,  the Lord explains
the process in the followi ng verses. The Lord says that Brahman, although one
without a second, has various manifestat ions and features. Especially for the
impersonalists, the akñara,  or oàkära —the syllable oà—is identical with
Brahman. Kåñëa here explains the impersonal Brahman, i n which the
renounced order of sages enter.
In the Vedic system of knowledge, st udents, from the very beginning, are
taught to vibrate oà and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living
with the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of
Brahman’s features. This pr actice is very essential for the student’s
advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmacäré  (unmarriedCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has
changed so much that there is no possibility of one’s pra cticing celibacy from
the beginning of student life. Th roughout the world there are many
institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized
institution where students can be educated in the brahmacäré  principles.
Unless one pra ctices celibacy, advancement in sp iritual life is very difficult.
Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural
injunctions for this Age of Kali, that in  this age no process of realizing the
Supreme is possible except the chanting of t he holy names of Lord Kåñëa: Hare
Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma
Räma, Hare Hare.

The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements.
Closing all the doors of the senses and fi xing the mind on the heart and the life
air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT
To practice yoga as suggested here, one first has to close the doors of all
sense enjoyment. This practice is called pratyähära,  or withdrawing the senses
from the sense objects. The sense organs for acquiring knowledge—the eyes,
ears, nose, tongue and tou ch—should be fully controlled and should not be
allowed to engage in self-gratification . In this way the mind focuses on the
Supersoul in the heart, and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In the
Sixth Chapter this process is described in deta il. But as mentioned before, this
practice is not practical in this age. Th e best process is Kåñëa consciousness. If
one is always able to fix his mind on Kåñë a in devotional service, it is very easy
for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental tranc e, or in samädhi.

It is clearly stated here that oà, Brahman and Lord Kåñëa are not different.
The impersonal sound of Kåñëa is oà, but the sound Hare Kåñëa contains oà.
The chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra  is clearly recommended for this age.

Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, he
certainly reaches one of the spiritual planets, according to the mode of his
practice. The devotees of Kåñëa enter the Kåñëa planet, Golo ka Våndävana.
For the personalists there are also innumerable other planets, known as
Vaikuëöha planets, in the spiritual sky,  whereas the impersonalists remain in
the brahmajyoti.

For one who always remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O
son of Påthä, because of his constant engagement in devotional service.
PURPORT
This verse especially describes the final destination attained by the
unalloyed devotees who serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
bhakti-yoga.  Previous verses have mentioned four different kinds of
devotees—the distressed, the inquisitive, those who  seek material gain, and
the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been
described: karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga  and haöha-yoga.  The principles of these yoga
systems have some bhakti  added, but this verse particularly mentions pure
bhakti-yoga,  without any mixture of jïäna, karma  or haöha.  As indicated by the
word ananya-cetäù,  in pure bhakti-yoga  the devotee desires nothing but Kåñëa.
A pure devotee does not desire promot ion to heavenly planets, nor does he
seek oneness with the brahmajyoti  or salvation or liberation from material
entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the
Caitanya-caritämåta  the pure devotee is called niñkäma,  which means he has
no desire for self-interest. Perfec t peace belongs to him alone, not  to them who
strive for personal gain. Whereas a jïäna-yogé, karma-yogé  or haöha-yogé  has his
own selfish interests, a perfect devotee ha s no desire other than to please the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefor e the Lord says that for anyone who
is unf linchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.
A pure devotee always engages in devoti onal service to Kåñëa in one of His
various personal features. Kåñëa has various plenary expansions and
incarnations, such as Räma and Nåsiàh a, and a devotee can choose to fix his
mind in loving service to any of thes e transcendental forms of the Supreme
Lord. Such a devotee meets with none  of the problems that plague the
practitioners of other yogas.  Bhakti-yoga  is very simple and pure and easy to
perform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare Kåñëa. The Lord is merci fulCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.to all, but as we have already explained, He is especially inclined toward those
who always serve Him without deviatio n. The Lord helps such devotees in
various ways. As stated in the Vedas  (Kaöha Upaniñad  1.2.23 ), yam evaiña våëute
tena labhyas/ tasya iña ätmä vivåëute tanuà sväm:  one who is fully surrendered
and engaged in the devotional servic e of the Supreme Lord can understand
the Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated in Bhagavad-gétä  (10.10 ), dadämi
buddhi-yogaà tam:  the Lord gives such a devotee su fficient intelligence so that
ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.
The special qualification of the pure devo tee is that he is always thinking of
Kåñëa without deviation and without considering the time or place. There
should be no impediments. He should be  able to carry out his service anywhere
and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like
Våndävana or some holy town where th e Lord lived, but a pure devotee can
live anywhere and create the atmosp here of Våndävana by his devotional
service. It was Çré Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, “Wherever  You are, O
Lord— there  is Våndävana.”
As indicated by the words satatam  and nityaçaù,  which mean “always,”
“regularly,” or “every day,” a pure devotee constantly remembers Kåñëa and
meditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom
the Lord is most easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga  is the system that the Gétä
recommends above all others. Generally, the bhakti-yogés  are engaged in five
different ways: (1) çänta-bhakta,  engaged in devotional service in neutrality;
(2) däsya-bhakta,  engaged in devotional service as servant; (3 ) säkhya-bhakta,
engaged as friend; (4) vätsalya-bhakta,  engaged as parent; and (5)
mädhurya-bhakta,  engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of
these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the
transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the
Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee
cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord
cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great bless ing of the
Kåñëa conscious process of chanting the mahä-mantra —Hare Kåñëa, Hare
Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare

longer desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to
be transferred to any spiritual planet . They only want Kåñëa and Kåñëa’s
association, and nothing else. That is th e highest perfection of life. This verse
specifically mentions the personalist devotees of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa.
These devotees in Kåñëa con sciousness achieve the highest perfection of life.
In other words, they are the supreme souls.

go to Kåñëa’s transcendental abode an d never return. Those who attain the
highest material planets, the pla nets of the demigods, are again subjected to
repeated birth and death. As persons on  earth are elevated to higher planets,
people on higher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka and Indraloka fall
down to earth. The practice of sacrifice called païcägni-v idyä,  recommended in
the Chändogya Upaniñad,  enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but if, on
Brahmaloka, one does not cultivate Kåñë a consciousness, then he must return
to earth. Those who progress in Kåñëa co nsciousness on the higher planets are
gradually e levated to higher and higher plan ets and at the time of universal
devastation are transferred to the eter nal spiritual kingdom. Çrédhara Svämé,

By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together form the duration of
Brahmä’s one day. And such also is the duration of his night.
PURPORT
The duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of
kalpas.  A kalpa  is a day of Brahmä, and one day of Brahmä consists of a
thousand cycles of four yugas,  or ages: Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali. The
cycle of Satya is characteri zed by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being
practically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga  lasts 1,728,000 years. In the
Tretä-yuga vice is introduced, and this yuga  lasts 1,296,000 years. In the
Dväpara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue  and religion, vice
increasing, and this yuga  lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the
yuga  we have now been experiencing ov er the past 5,000 years) there is an
abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion  and vice, true virtue being practically
nonexistent, and this yuga  lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to
such a point that at the termination of the yuga  the Supreme Lord Himself
appears as the Kalki avatära,  vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and
commences another Satya-yuga . Then the process is set rolling again. These
four yugas,  rotating a thousand times, comp rise one day of Brahmä, and the
same number comprise one night. Brahmä lives one hundred of such “years”
and then dies. These “hundred years” by earth calculations to tal to 311 trillion
and 40 billion earth years. By these ca lculations the life of Brahmä seems
fantastic and interminable, but from the view point of eternity it is as brief as a

In the material universe not even Brah mä is free from the process of birth,
old age, disease and death. Brahmä, however, is directly engaged in the service
of the Supreme Lord in the management  of this universe—therefore he at
once attains liberation. Elev ated sannyäsés  are promoted to Brahmä’s particular
planet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and
which survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary
system, but in due course Brahmä and all the inhabi tants of Brahmaloka are
subject to death, according to the law of material nature.

world. But those intelligent persons wh o take to Kåñëa consciousness use the
human life fully in the devotional ser vice of the Lord, chanting Hare Kåñëa,

PURPORT
The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is described in
the Brahma-saàhitä  as cintämaëi-dhäma , a place where all desires are fulfilled.
The supreme abode of Lord Kåñëa, known as Goloka Våndävana, is full ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.palaces made of touchstone. There  are also trees, called “desire trees,” that
supply any type of eatable upon de mand, and there are cows, known as surabhi
cows, which supply a limitless supply of mi lk. In this abode, the Lord is served
by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lak ñmés), and He is called
Govinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed
to blow His flute ( veëuà kvaëantam ). His transcendental form is the most
attractive in all the worlds—His eyes ar e like lotus petals, and the color of His
body is like the color of clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that
of thousands of Cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and
a peacock feather in His hair. In the Bhagavad-gétä  Lord Kåñëa gives only a
small hint of His pe rsonal abode, Goloka Våndävana, which is the supermost
planet in the spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the
Brahma-saàhitä.  Vedic literatures ( Kaöha Upaniñad  1.3.11 ) state that there is
nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is
the ultimate destination ( puruñän na paraà kiïcit sä käñöhä paramä gatiù ).
When one attains to it, he never returns to the material world. Kåñëa’s
supreme abode and Kåñëa Himself are nond ifferent, being of the same quality.
On this e arth, Våndävana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that
supreme Goloka Våndävana located in  the spiritual sky. When Kåñëa
descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known as
Våndävana, comprising about eighty-four s quare miles in the district of
Mathurä, India.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, wh o is greater than all, is attainable
by unalloyed devotion. Although He is present in His abode, He is
all-pervading, and everything is situated within Him.
PURPORT
It is here clearly stated that the supr eme destination, from which there is no
return, is the abode of Kåñëa, the Supreme Person. The Brahma-saàhitä
describes this supreme abode as änanda-cinmaya-rasa , a place where
everything is full of spiritual bliss. A ll the variegatedness manifest there is of
the quality of spiritual bliss—nothing th ere is material. That variegatedness is
expanded as the spiritual expansion of  the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the
manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter
Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always
in His supreme abode, He is nonethele ss all-pervading by His material energy.
So by His spiritual and material ener gies He is present everywhere—both in
the material and in the spiritual universes. Yasyäntaù-sthäni  means that
everything is sustained within Him, wi thin either His spiritual or material
energy. The Lord is all-pervading by these two energies.
To enter Kåñëa’s supreme abode or the innumerable Vaikuëöha planets is
possible only by bhakti,  devotional service, as clearly indicated here by the
word bhaktyä.  No other process can help one attain that supreme abode. TheCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Vedas  (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  3.2) also describe the supreme abode and the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Eko vaçé sarva-gaù kåñëaù.  In that abode
there is only one Supreme Personality of  Godhead, whose name is Kåñëa. He is
the supreme merciful Deity, and although situated there as one He has
expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. The Vedas
compare the Lord to a tree standing sti ll yet bearing many varieties of fruits,
flowers and changing leaves. The plenar y expansions of the Lord who preside
over the Vaikuëö ha planets are four-armed, and they are known by a variety of
names—Puruñottama, Trivikrama, Keçava, Mädhava, Aniruddha, Håñékeça,
Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna, Çrédhara, Väsudeva, Dämodara, Janärdana,
Näräyaëa, Vämana, Padmanäbha, etc.
The Brahma-saàhitä  (5.37) also confirms that although the Lord is always
in the supreme abode, Goloka Våndävana, He is all-pervading, so that
everything is going on nicely ( goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù ). As stated
in the Vedas  (Çvetäçvatara Upaniña d 6.8), paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate/
sväbhäviké jïäna-bala-kriyä ca:  His energies are so expansive that they
systematically conduct everything in th e cosmic manifestation without a flaw,
although the Supreme Lord is far, far away.

O best of the Bhäratas, I shall now explain to you the different times at
which, passing away from this world, the yogé does or does not come back.
PURPORT
The unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord, who are totally surrendered
souls, do not care when they leave thei r bodies or by what method. They leave
everything in Kåñëa’s hands and so easi ly and happily return to Godhead. But
those who are not unalloyed d evotees and who depend instead on such
methods of spiritual realization as karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga  and haöha-yoga  must
leave the body at a suitable time and thereby be assured whether or not they
will return to the world of birth and death.
If the yogé is perfect he can select the time and situation for leaving this
material world. But if he is not so expert his success depends on his
accidentally passing away at a certain suitable time. The suitable times at
which one passes away and does no t come back are explained by the Lord in
the next verse. According to Äcärya Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa, the Sanskrit
word käla used herein refers to the presiding deity of time.

during the six months when the sun tr avels in the north.
PURPORT
When fire, light, day and the fortnight of the moon are mentioned, it is to
be understood that over all of them there are various presiding deities who
make arrangements for the passage of th e soul. At the time of death, the mind
carries one on the path to  a new life. If one leaves the body at the time
designated above, either accidentally or  by arrangement, it is possible for him
to attain the impersonal brahmajyoti.  Mystics who are advanced in yoga
practice can arrange the time and place to leave the body . Others have no
control—if by accident they leave at an  auspicious moment, then they will not
return to the cycle of birth and death,  but otherwise there is every possibility
that they will have to return. Howe ver, for the pure devotee in Kåñëa
consciousn ess, there is no fear of returning,  whether he leaves the body at an
auspicious or inauspicious moment, by accident or arrangement.

In the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam  Kapila Muni mentions that

attain to the moon at death. These elev ated souls live on the moon for about
10,000 years (by demigod calculation s) and enjoy life by drinking soma-rasa.
They eventually return to earth. Th is means that on the moon there are
higher classes of living beings, though they may not be perceived by the gross

PURPORT
The same description of departure and return is quoted by Äcärya Baladeva
Vidyäbhüñaëa from the Chändogya Upaniñad  (5.10.3–5 ). Those who are
fruitive laborers and philosophical speculators from time immemorial are
constantly going and coming. Actually they  do not attain ultimate salvation,

Although the devotees know these two paths, O Arjuna, they are never

PURPORT
Kåñëa is here advising Arjuna that he should not be disturbed by the
different paths the soul can take when leaving the material world. A devotee
of the Supreme Lord should not worry whether he will depart by arrangement
or by accident. The devotee should be firmly established in Kåñëa
consciousness and chant Hare Kåñëa. He should know that concern over
either of these two paths is troublesome.  The best way to be absorbed in Kåñëa
consciousness is to be always dovetailed  in His service, and this will make o ne’s
path to the spiritual kingdom sa fe, certain and direct. The word yoga-yukta  is
especially significant in this verse. One who is firm in yoga is constantly
engaged in Kåñëa consciousness in all hi s activities. Çré Rüpa Gosvämé advises,
anäsaktasya viña yän yathärham upayuïjataù:  one should be unattached in
material affairs and do everything in Kåñëa consciousness. By this system,
which is called yukta-vairägya , one attains perfection. Therefore the devotee is
not disturbed by these descriptions, because he knows that his passage to the
supreme abode is guaranteed by devotional service.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  28

TRANSLATION
A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the
results derived from studying the Vedas, performing austere sacrifices, giving
charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. Simply by performing
devotional service, he a ttains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme
eternal abode.
PURPORT
This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth chapters, whichCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.particularly deal with Kåñëa consciousn ess and devotional service. One has to
study the Vedas  under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many
austerities and penances while l iving under his care. A brahmacäré  has to live
in the home of the spiritual master just  like a servant, and he must beg alms
from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only
under the master’s order, and if the master neglects t o call the student for food
that day, the student fasts. These ar e some of the Vedic principles for
observing brahmacarya.
After the student studies the Vedas  under the master for a period from five
to twenty years, he may become a ma n of perfect character. Study of the Vedas
is not meant for the recreation of armc hair speculators, but for the formation
of character. After thi s training, the brahmacäré  is allowed to enter into
household life and marry. When he is a householder, he has to perform many
sacrifices so that he may achieve furt her enlightenment. He must also give
charity according to the country, time and candidate, discriminating among
charity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described in Bhagavad-gétä.
Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of
vänaprastha,  he undergoes severe penances—living in forests, dressing with
tree bark,  not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of brahmacarya,
householder life, vänaprastha  and finally sannyäsa,  one becomes elevated to
the perfectional stage of life. Some  are then elevated to the heavenly
kingdoms, and when they become even more advanc ed they are liberated in
the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti  or in the Vaikuëöha
planets or Kåñëaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.
The beauty of Kåñëa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by
engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different
orders of life.
The words idaà viditvä  indicate that one should understand the
instructions given by Çré Kåñëa in th is chapter and the Seventh Chapter of
Bhagavad-gétä.  One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship
or mental speculation but by hearing the m in association with devotees.
Chapters Seven through Twelve are the essence of Bhagavad-gétä.  The first six
and the last six chapters are like cove rings for the middle six chapters, whichCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.are especially protected by the Lord. If one is fortunate enough t o understand
Bhagavad-gétä —especially these middle six chapters—in the association of
devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances,
sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc ., for one can achieve all the results of
these activities simply by Kåñëa consciousness.
One who has a little faith in Bhagavad-gétä  should learn Bhagavad-gétä  from
a devotee, because in the beginning of th e Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly
that Bhagavad-gétä  can be understood only by devotees; no one else can
perfectly understand the purpo se of Bhagavad-gétä.  One should therefore learn
Bhagavad-gétä  from a devotee of Kåñëa, not from mental speculators. This is a
sign of faith. When one searches for a devotee and finally gets a devotee’s
association one actually begins to study and understan d Bhagavad-gétä.  By
advancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional
service, and this service dispels all one’ s misgivings about Kåñëa, or God, and
Kåñëa’s activities, form, pastimes, name and other features. After these
misgiving s have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one’s study.
Then one relishes the study of Bhagavad-gétä  and attains the state of feeling
always Kåñëa conscious. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love
with Kåñëa. This highest perfect ional stage of life enables the devotee to be
transferred to Kåñëa’s abode in the spir itual sky, Goloka Våndävana, where the
devotee becomes eternally happy.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Attaining the Supreme.

enlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam:
“The messages of the Supreme Personal ity of Godhead are full of potencies,
and these potencies can be realized if  topics regarding the Supreme GodheadCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.are discussed amongst devotees. This ca nnot be achieved by the association of
mental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.”
The devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord’s service. The
Lord understands the mentality and sincer ity of a particular living entity who
is engaged in Kåñëa consciousne ss and gives him the intelligence to
understand the science of Kåñëa in the  association of devotees. Discussion of
Kåñëa is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to
assimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward
spiritual realization. Lord Kåñëa, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and
higher elevation in His potent service,  describes in this Ninth Chapter matters
more confidential than any He has already disclosed.
The very beginning of Bhagavad-gétä,  the First Chapter, is more or less an
introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third chapters,
the spiritual knowledge described is calle d confidential. Topics discussed in the
Seventh and Eighth chap ters are specifically related to devotional service, and
because they bring enlightenment in Kåñëa consciousness, they are called
more confidential. But the matters whic h are described in the Ninth Chapter
deal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this  is called the most
confidential. One who is situated in th e most confidential knowledge of Kåñëa
is naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is
in the material world. In the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  it is said that although
one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is
situated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered
liberated. Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-gétä,  Tenth Chapter, that
anyone who is engaged  in that way is a liberated person.
Now this first verse has specific significance. The words idaà jïänam  (“this
knowledge”) refer to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different
activities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying,
obeying, maintaining frien dship and surrendering everything. By the practice
of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual
consciousness, Kåñëa consciousness. When one’s heart is thus cleared of
material contamination, one can understand this science of Kåñëa. Simply to
understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may beCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference
between activities of the body and the spiritual activities of one who
understan ds that he is not the body.
In the Seventh Chapter we have alre ady discussed the opulent potency of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hi s different energies, the inferior and
superior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapter Nine the
glories of the Lord will be delineated.
The Sanskrit word anasüyave  in this verse is also very significant. Generally
the commentators, even if they are high ly scholarly, are all envious of Kåñëa,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on
Bhagavad-gétä  very inac curately. Because they are envious of Kåñëa, their
commentaries are useless. The commentarie s given by devotees of the Lord are
bona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-gétä  or give perfect knowledge of
Kåñëa if he is envious. One who criticizes the characte r of Kåñëa without
knowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided.
For one who understands that Kåñëa is  the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
the pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial.

TRANSLATION
This knowledge is the king of education,  the most secret of all secrets. It is
the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by
realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully
performed.
PURPORT
This chapter of Bhagavad-gétä  is called the king of education because it is
the essence of all doctrines and phil osophies explained before. Among the
principal philosophers in India are Gautama, Kaëäda, Kapila, Yäjïavalkya,
Çäëòilya and Vaiçvänara. And fin ally there is Vyäsadeva, the author of the
Vedänta-sütra.  So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or
transcendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the
king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge t hat can be derived
from the study of the Vedas  and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most
confidential because confidential or  transcendental knowledge involves
understanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of
all confiden tial knowledge culminates in devotional service.
Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are
educated in external knowledge. As fa r as ordinary education is concerned,
people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics,
chemistry, mathematics, astro nomy, engineering, etc. There are so many
departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but
there is, unfortunately, no university  or educational institution where the
science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part
of the body; without the presence of th e soul, the body has no value. Still
people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for
the vital soul.
The Bhagavad-gétä,  especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.importance of the soul. In the very begi nning, the Lord says that this body is
perishable and that the soul is not perishable ( antavanta ime dehä nityasyoktäù
çarériëaù ). That is a conf idential part of knowledge:  simply knowing that the
spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable,
indestructible and eternal. But that gi ves no positive information about the
soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from
the body and that when the body is fini shed, or one is liberated from the body,
the soul remains in a void and becomes im personal. But actually that is not the
fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inact ive after
being liberated from the body? It is always  active. If it is eternal, then it is
eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most
confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are
therefor e indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most
confidential part of all knowledge.
This knowledge is the purest form of  all activities, as explained in Vedic
literature. In the Padma Puräëa,  man’s sinful activities have been analyzed and
are shown to be the results of sin afte r sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive
activities are entang led in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For
instance, when the seed of a particular  tree is sown, the tree does not appear
immediately to grow; it takes some time. It  is first a small, sprouting plant, then
it assumes the form of a tree, the n it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is
complete, the flowers and fruits are en joyed by persons who have sown the
seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs  a sinful act, and like a seed it takes
time to fructify. There are different stages. The sin ful action may have already
stopped within the individual, but the resu lts or the fruit of that sinful action
are still to be enjoyed. There are sins wh ich are still in the form of a seed, and
there are others which are already fructified and are giving us  fruit, which we
are enjoying as distress and pain.
As explained in the twenty-eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter , a person
who has completely ended the reactions of  all sinful activities and who is fully
engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world,
becomes engaged in d evotional service to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kåñëa. In other words, th ose who are actually engaged in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.devotional service of the Supreme Lord  are already freed from all reactions.
This statement is confirmed in the Padma Puräëa:
aprärabdha-phalaà päpaà
küöaà béjaà phalonmukham
krameëaiva praléyeta
viñëu-bhakti-ratätmanäm
For those who are engaged in the de votional service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, all sinful reacti ons, whether fructified, in the stock, or
in the form of a seed, gradually vani sh. Therefore the purifying potency of
devotional service is very str ong, and it is called pavitram uttamam,  the purest.
Uttama  means transcendental. Tamas  means this material world or darkness,
and uttama  means that which is transcende ntal to material activities.
Devotional activities are never to be considered material, a lthough sometimes
it appears that devotees are engaged ju st like ordinary men. One who can see
and is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material
activities. They are all spiritual an d devotional, uncontaminated by the
material mo des of nature.
It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can
perceive the results directly. This direct  result is actually perceived, and we
have practical experience that any pers on who is chanting the holy names of
Kåñëa (Hare Kåñëa, Ha re Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare
Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare) in course of chanting without offenses feels
some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material
contamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in
hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well,
or if he engages himself in helpin g the missionary activities of Kåñëa
consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in
spirit ual life does not depend on an y kind of previous education or
qualification. The method itself is so pu re that by simply engaging in it one
becomes pure.
In the Vedänta-sütra  (3.2.26 ) this is also described in the following words:
prakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät.  “Devotional service is so potent that simply byCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.engaging in the activities of devoti onal service one becomes enlightened
without a doubt.” A practica l example of this can be seen in the previous life
of Närada, who in that life happened to  be the son of a maidservant. He had
no education, nor was he born into a high family. But when his mother was
engaged in serving great devotees, Närada also became e ngaged, and
sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees
himself. Närada personally says,
ucchiñöa-lepän anumodito dvijaiù
sakåt sma bhuïje tad-apästa-kilbiñaù
evaà pravåttasya viçuddha-cetasas
tad-dharma evätma-ruciù prajäyate
In this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.5.25 ) Närada describes his previous
life to his disciple Vyäsadeva. He says  that while engaged as a boy servant for
those purified devotees during the four months of their stay, he was intimately
associating with the m. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their
dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the
remnants. So he asked the great devotees for their permission, and when they
gave it Närada ate those remnants and consequently be came freed from all
sinful reactions. As he went on eating , he gradually became as pure-hearted as
the sages. The great devotees relished th e taste of unceasing devotional service
to the Lord by hearing and chanting, and Närada gradually developed the
same  taste. Närada says further,
tatränvahaà kåñëa-kathäù pragäyatäm
anugraheëäçåëavaà manoharäù
täù çraddhayä me ’nupadaà viçåëvataù
priyaçravasy aìga mamäbhavad ruciù
By associating with the sages, Närada got the taste for hearing and chanting
the glories of the Lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional service.
Therefore, as described in the Vedänta-sütra,  prakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät:  if
one is engaged simp ly in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed
to him automatically, and he can understand. This is called pratyakña,  directlyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.perceived.
The word dharmyam  means “the path of religion.” Närada was actually a
son of a maidservant. He had no opport unity to go to school. He was simply
assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the
devotees. The child Närada also g ot the opportunity and simply by association
achieved the highest goal of all religi on. The highest goal of all religion is
devotional service, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (sa vai puàsäà paro
dharmo yato bhaktir adhokñaje ). Religious people generally do  not know that
the highest perfection of religion is th e attainment of devotional service. As
we have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight ( vedeñu
yajïeñu tapaùsu caiva ), generally Vedic knowledge is required for
self-realization.  But here, although Närada never went to the school of the
spiritual master and was not educated in  the Vedic principles, he acquired the
highest results of Vedic study. This pr ocess is so potent that even without
performing the religious process regularly , one can be raised to the highest
perfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature:
äcäryavän puruño veda.  One who is in association with great äcäryas,  even if he
is not educated or has never studied the Vedas,  can become fami liar with all
the knowledge necessary for realization.
The process of devotional se rvice is a very happy one ( susukham ). Why?
Devotional service consists of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23] , so one can
simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical
lectures on transcendenta l knowledge given by authorized äcäryas.  Simply by
sitting, one can learn; then one can ea t the remnants of the food offered to
God, nice palatable dishes. In every stat e devotional service is joyful. One can
execute devotional service even in the most pov erty-stricken condition. The
Lord says, patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam : H e  i s  r e a d y  t o  a c c e p t  f r o m  t h e
devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of
fruit, or a little water, which are all av ailable in every part of the world, can be
offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if
offered with love. There are many instan ces in history. Simply by tasting the
tulasé  leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kumära
became gre at devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and itCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.can be executed in a happy mood. God a ccepts only the love with which things
are offered to Him.
It is said here that this devotional se rvice is eternally existing. It is not as
the Mäyävädé philosophers claim. Althou gh they sometimes take to so-called
devotional service, their idea is that as  long as they are not liberated they will
continue their de votional service, but at the end, when they become liberated,
they will “become one with God.” Such  temporary time-serving devotional
service is not accepted as pure devotion al service. Actual devotional service
continues even after liberation. When the de votee goes to the spiritual planet
in the kingdom of God, he is also en gaged there in serving the Supreme Lord.
He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.
As will be seen in Bhagavad-gétä,  actual devotional service begins after
liberation. After one is liberated, wh en one is situated in the Brahman
position ( brahma-bhüta ), one’s devotional service begins ( samaù sarveñu
bhüteñu mad-bhaktià labhate paräm ). No one can understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, añöäìga-yoga  or
any other yoga independently. By these yogic methods one may make a little
progress toward bhakti-yoga,  but without coming to the stage of devotional
service one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by
executing the process of devotional  service, especially by hearing
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  or Bhagavad-gétä  from re alized souls, then he can
understand the science of Kåñëa, or the science of God. Evaà
prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti yogataù . When one’s heart is cleared of all
nonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of
devotional service, of Kåñ ëa consciousness, is the king of all education and the
king of all confidential knowledge. It is  the purest form of religion, and it can
be executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it.

Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O

PURPORT
The faithless cannot accomplish this pr ocess of devotional service; that is
the purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees.
Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature
from great personalities, stil l have no faith in God. They are hesitant and
cannot stay fixed in the devotional serv ice of the Lord. Thus faith is a most
important factor for progress in Kåñëa consciousness. In the
Caitanya-caritämåta  it is said that faith is the complete conviction th at simply
by serving the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, one can achieve all perfection. That is
called real faith. As stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (4.31.14 ),
yathä taror müla-niñecanena
tåpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaçäkhäù
präëopahäräc ca yathendriyäëäàCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.tathaiva sarvärhaëam acyutejyä
“By giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches, twigs and
leaves, and by supplying food to the stom ach one satisfies all the senses of the
body. Similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord
one automatically s atisfies all the demigods and all other living entities.”
Therefore, after reading Bhagavad-gétä  one should promptly come to the
conclusion of Bhagavad-gétä:  one should give up all other engagements and
adopt the service of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, the Per sonality of Godhead. If
one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith.
Now, the development of that faith is the process of Kåñëa consciousness.
There are three divisions of Kåñëa consci ous men. In the third class are those
who have no faith. Even if they are officially engaged in devotional service,
they cannot achieve the h ighest perfectional stage. Most probably they will
slip, after some time. They may become  engaged, but because they haven’t
complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in
Kåñëa consciousness. We have practical experience in dis charging our
missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to Kåñëa
consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a
little well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It
is only b y faith that one can advance in Kåñëa consciousness. As far as the
development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of
devotional service and has attained the st age of firm faith is called a first-class
person in Kåñëa conscious ness. And in the second class are those who are not
very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who
automatically have firm faith that kåñëa-bhakti,  or service to Kåñëa, is the best
course and so in good faith ha ve taken it up. Thus they a re superior to the
third class, who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good
faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class
person in Kåñëa consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second
class he does not fall down, and for the first-class person in Kåñëa
consciousness there is no chance of fa lling down. One in the first class will
surely make progress and achieve the result  at the end. As far as the third-class
person in Kåñëa consciousness is con cerned, although he has faith in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.conviction that devotional service to Kå ñëa is very good, he has not yet gained
adequate knowledge of Kåñëa through the scriptures like Çrémad-Bhägavatam
and Bhagavad-gétä.  Sometimes these third-class persons in Kåñëa c onsciousness
have some tendency toward karma-yoga  and jïäna-yoga,  and sometimes they
are disturbed, but as soon as the infection of karma-yoga  or jïäna-yoga  is
vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in Kåñëa
consciousness. Faith in Kåñ ëa is also divided into three stages and described in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  First-class attachment, second-class attachment and
third-class attachment are also explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  in the
Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing ab out Kåñëa and
the excellence of devotional service, wh o think that it is simply eulogy, find
the path very difficult, even if they  are supposedly engaged in devotional
service. For them there is very little ho pe of gaining perfection. Thus faith is
very im portant in the discharge of devotional service.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross
material senses. It is said,

na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù
sevonmukhe hi jihvädau
svayam eva sphuraty adaù
(Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  1.2.234 )
Lord Çré Kåñëa’s name, fame, pastim es, etc., cannot be understood by
material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under
proper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.38) it is stated,
premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocane na santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti:  one
can see the Supreme Personality of Godh ead, Govinda, always within himself
and outside himself if one has develope d the transcendental loving attitude
towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. He re it is said that
although He is all-pervading, everywhere  present, He is not conceivable by the
material senses. This is indicated here by the word avyakta-mürtinä.  But
actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we
have discus sed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic
manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies—the
superior, spiritual energy and the inferio r, material energy. Just as the sunshine
is spread all over the universe, the energy of t he Lord is spread all over the
creation, and everything is resting in that energy.
Yet one should not conclude that becaus e He is spread all over He has lost
His personal existence. To refute su ch an argument the Lord says, “I am
everywhere, and everything is in Me, bu t still I am aloof.” For example, a king
heads a government which is b ut the manifestation of the king’s energy; the
different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.and each department is resting on the king’s power. But still one cannot
expect the king to be present in every department personall y. That is a crude
example. Similarly, all the manifestat ions that we see and everything that
exists, both in this material world and in  the spiritual world, are resting on the
energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by
the d iffusion of His different energies, and, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä,
viñöabhyäham idaà kåtsnam : He is everywhere present by His personal
representation, the diffusion of His different energies.

The Lord says that everything is resting on Him ( mat-sthäni sarva-bhütäni ).
This should not be misunderstood. The Lo rd is not directly concerned with the
maintenance and sustenance of this mate rial manifestation. Sometimes we see
a picture of Atlas holding  the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired,
holding this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in
connection with Kåñëa’s upholding th is created universe. He says that
although everything is resting on Him, He is aloof. The planetary systems are
floating in space, and this space is th e energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is
different from space. He is different ly situated. Therefore the Lord says,
“Although they are situated on My inconceivable energy, as the Supreme
Perso nality of Godhead I am aloof from them.” This is the inconceivable
opulence of the Lord.
In the Nirukti  Vedic dictionary it is said, yujyate ’nena durghaöeñu käryeñu:
“The Supreme Lord is performing inconceivably wonderful pastimes,
displaying His energy.” His person is fu ll of different potent energies, and His
determination is itself actual fact. In this way the Personality of Godhead is to
be understood. We may think of doin g something, but there are so many
impediments, and sometimes it is not possi ble to do as we like. But when Kåñëa
wants to do something, simply by His willing, everything  is performed so
perfectly that one cannot imagine how it  is being done. The Lord explains this
fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer of the entire material
manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His
supreme wil l, everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is
maintained, and everything is annihilate d. There is no difference between His
mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present
material mind) because He is absolut e spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is
present in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also
present personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet
everything is resting on Him. This is explained here as yogam aiçvaram , the
mystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  6

TRANSLATION
Understand that as the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, rests always in
the sky, all created beings rest in Me.
PURPORT
For the ordinary person it is almost  inconceivable how the huge material
creation is resting in Him. But the Lo rd is giving an example which may help
us to understand. The sky may be the biggest manifestation we can conceive.
And in that sky the wind or ai r is the biggest manifestation in the cosmic
world. The movement of the air influe nces the movements of everything. But
although the wind is great, it is still situated within the sky; the wind is not
beyond the sky. Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic man ifestations are existing
by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme
will. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will:
by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and
everything is being annihilated. Still He  is aloof from everything, as the sky is
always aloof from the activities of the wind.
In the Upaniñads  it is stated, yad-bhéñä vätaù pavate:  “It is out of the fear of
the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.” ( Taittiréya Upaniñad  2.8.1) In the
Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad  (3.8.9 ) it is stated, etasya vä akñarasya praçäsane gärgi
sürya-candrama sau vidhåtau tiñöhata etasya vä akñarasya praçäsane gärgi
dyäv-äpåthivyau vidhåtau tiñöhataù.  “By the supreme order, under the
superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun,
and the other great planets are moving.” In the Brahma- saàhitä  (5.52) also it is
stated,
yac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäà
räjä samasta-sura-mürtir açeña-tejäù
yasyäjïayä bhramati sambhåta-käla-cakro

This is a description of the movement of  the sun. It is said that the sun is
considered to be one of the eyes of th e Supreme Lord and that it has immense
potency to diffuse heat and light. Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the
order and the sup reme will of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can
find evidence that this material manife station, which appears to us to be very
wonderful and great, is under the complete control of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. This will be further explain ed in the later verses of this chapter.

TRANSLATION
O son of Kunté, at the end of the millennium all material manifestations
enter into My nature, and at the beginning of another millennium, by My
potency, I create them again.
PURPORT
The creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material cosmic
manifestation are completely dependent on the supreme will of the Personality
of Godhead. “At the end of the millennium” means at the death of Brahmä.
Brahmä lives for one hundred years, an d his one day is calculated at
4,300,000,000 of our earthly years. His ni ght is of the same duration. His
month consists of thirty such days and nights, and his year of twelve months.
After one hundred such years, when  Brahmä dies, the devastation or
annih ilation takes place; this means th at the energy manifested by the
Supreme Lord is again wound up in Hims elf. Then again, when there is a need
to manifest the cosmic world, it is done by His will. Bahu syäm:  “Although I am
one, I shall become many.” This is  the Vedic aphorism ( Chändogya Upaniñad
6.2.3 ). He expands Himself in this ma terial energy, and the whole cosmic
manifestation again takes place.

TRANSLATION
The whole cosmic order is under Me. Under My will it is automatically
manifested again and again, and under My will it is annihilated at the end.
PURPORT
This material world is the manifestat ion of the inferior energy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This  has already been explained several
times. At the creation, the material energy is let loose as the mahat-tattva,  into
which the Lord as His first Pu ruña incarnation, Mahä-Viñëu, enters. He lies
within the Causal Ocean and breathes out innumerable universes, and into
each universe the Lord again enters as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. Each universe is
in that way created. He still further manifests Himself as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu,
and that Viñëu enters into everything —even into the minute atom. This fact
is explained here. He enters into everything.
Now, as far as the living entities are concerned, they are impregnated into
this material nature, and as a result of their past deeds they take different
positions. Thus the activities of this ma terial world begin. The activities of theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.different species o f living beings are begun from the very moment of the
creation. It is not that all is evolved. The different species of life are created
immediately along with the universe. Men, animals, beasts, birds—everything
is simultaneously created, because whatever  desires the living entities had at
the last annihilation are again manifested . It is clearly indicated here by the
word avaçam  that the living entities have nothing to do with this process. The
state of being in their past life  in the past creation is sim ply manifested again,
and all this is done simply by His will. This is the inconceivable potency of the
Supreme Personality of God. And after creating different species of life, He
has no connection with them. The crea tion takes place to accommodate the
inclinations of the various living entities, and so the Lord does not become
involved with it.

One should not think, in this connect ion, that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead has no engagement. In His spir itual world He is always engaged. In
the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.6) it is stated, ätmärämasya tasyästi prakåtyä na
samägamaù:  “He is always involved i n His eternal, blissful, spiritual activities,
but He has nothing to do with these material activities.” Material activities are
being carried on by His different potencie s. The Lord is always neutral in the
material activities of the created world. This n eutrality is mentioned here with
the word udäséna-vat.  Although He has control ov er every minute detail of
material activities, He is sitting as if  neutral. The example can be given of a
high-court judge sitting on his benc h .  B y  h i s  o r d e r  s o  m a n y  t h i n g s  a r e
happening—someone is being hanged, some one is being put into jail, someone
is awarded a huge amount of wealth—but still he is neutral. He has nothing to
do with all that gain and loss. Similarl y, the Lord is always neutral, although
He has His hand in ev ery sphere of activity. In the Vedänta-sütra  (2.1.34 ) it is
stated, vaiñamya-nairghåëye na:  He is not situated in the dualities of this
material world. He is transcendental to  these dualities. Nor is He attached to
the creation and annihilation of this mat erial world. The living entities take
their different forms in the various specie s of life according to their past deeds,
and the Lord doesn’t interfere with them.

This material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My

PURPORT
It is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the
activities of the material world, re mains the supreme director. The Supreme
Lord is the supreme will and the backgr ound of this material manifestation,
but the management is being  conducted by material nature. Kåñëa also states
in Bhagavad-gétä  that of all of the living entiti es in different forms and species,
“I am the father.” The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the
child, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His me re glance injects all the living
entities into the womb of material natu re, and they come out in their different
forms and species, according to their last  desires and activities. All these living
entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lor d, take their
different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not
directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material
nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created
immediately. Beca use He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly
activity on the part of the Supreme Lo rd, but He has nothing to do with the
manifestation of the material world di rectly. This example is given in the
småti:  when there is a fragrant flower before s omeone, the fragrance is touched
by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower areCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the
material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has
nothing to  do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and
ordains. In summary, material nature , without the superintendence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, ca nnot do anything. Yet the Supreme
Personality is detached from all material activities .

PURPORT
From the other explanations of the pr evious verses in this chapter, it is
clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a
human being, is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, whoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.conducts the creation, maintenance and anni hilation of the complete cosmic
manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who
consider Kåñëa to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is
the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä
(éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù ); He is the Supreme Lord.
There are many éçvaras,  controllers, and one appears greater than another.
In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some
official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a
minister, and above him a preside nt. Each of them is a controller, but one is
controlled by another. In the Brahma-saàhitä  it is said that Kåñëa is the
supreme controller; there are many cont rollers undoubtedly, both in the
material and spiritual world, but Kåñëa is the supreme controller  (éçvaraù
paramaù kåñëaù ). and His body is sac-cid-änanda,  nonmaterial.
Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous
verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a
common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body
is called here mänuñém  becau se He is acting just like a man, a friend of
Arjuna’s, a politician involved in the Ba ttle of Kurukñetra. In so many ways He
is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is
sac-cid-änanda-vigraha  [Bs. 5.1]—eternal bliss and knowledge absolute . This is
confirmed in the Vedic language also. Sac-cid-änanda-rüpäya kåñëäya:  “I offer
my obeisances unto the Supreme Person ality of Godhead, Kåñëa, who is the
eternal blissful form of knowledge.” ( Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.1) There are
other descriptions in the Vedic language also. Tam ekaà govindam:  “You are
Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.” Sac-cid-änanda-vigraham:
“And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality.”
(Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.35)
Despite the transcendental qualities of  Lord Kåñëa’s body, its full bliss and
knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of
Bhagavad-gétä  who deride Kåñëa as an ordina ry man. The scholar may be born
an extraordinary man due to his previo us good work, but this conception of Çré
Kåñëa is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called müòha.  for
only foolish persons consider Kåñëa to  b e  a n  o r d i n a r y  h u m a n  b e i n g .  T h eCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.foolish consider Kåñëa an ordinary human being because they do not k now the
confidential activities of the Suprem e Lord and His different energies. They
do not know that Kåñëa’s body is a sy mbol of complete knowledge and bliss,
that He is the proprietor of everyt hing that be and that He can award
liberation to anyone. Beca use they do not know that Kåñëa has so many
transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.
Nor do they know that the appear ance of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in this material world is a mani festation of His internal energy. He is
the master of the material energy. As  has been explained in several places
(mama mäyä duratyayä ), He claims t hat the material energy, although very
powerful, is under His control, and wh oever surrenders unto Him can get out
of the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to Kåñëa can get
out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supr eme Lord, who
conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic
nature, have a material body like us? So  this conception of Kåñëa is complete
foolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of
Godhead, Kåñë a, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of
all the atoms and of the gigantic mani festation of the universal form. The
biggest and the minutest are beyond th eir conception, so they cannot imagine
that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite
and the minute. Actually although He is controlling the infinite and the
finite, He is apart from all this manife station. It is clearly stated concerning
His yogam aiçvaram , His inconceivable transcendental energy, t hat He can
control the infinite and the finite si multaneously and that He can remain
aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how Kåñëa, who
appears just like a human being, can co ntrol the infinite and the finite, those
who are pure devotees a ccept this, for they know that Kåñëa is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore they  completely surrender unto Him and
engage in Kåñëa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.
There are many controversies between the impersonalists and the
personalists about the Lord’s appearance  as a human being. But if we consult
Bhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  the authoritative texts for
understanding the science of Kåñëa, then we can un derstand that Kåñëa is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He
appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  First
Canto, First Chapter, when the sages he aded by Çaunaka inquired about the
activit ies of Kåñëa, they said:
kåtavän kila karmäëi
saha rämeëa keçavaù
ati-martyäni bhagavän
güòhaù kapaöa-mäëuñaù
“Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with
Balaräma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many
superhuman acts.” ( Bhäg.  1.1.20 ) The Lord’s appearance as a man bewilders the
foolish. No human being could perform the won derful acts that Kåñëa
performed while He was present on this  earth. When Kåñëa appeared before
His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaké, He appeared with four hands,
but after the prayers of the parents He  transformed Himself into an ordinary
child. As stated in the Bhägavatam  (10.3.46 ), babhüva präkåtaù çiçuù:  He
became just like an ordinary child, an  ordinary human being. Now, here again
it is indicated that the Lord’s appearan ce as an ordinary human being is one of
the features of His transcendental b ody. In the Eleventh Chapter of
Bhagavad-gétä  also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see Kåñëa’s form of four
hands ( tenaiva rüpeëa catur-bhujena ). After revealing this form, Kåñëa, when
petitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form ( mänuñaà
rüpam ). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those
of an ordinary human being.
Some of those who deride Kåñëa and who are infected with the Mäyävädé
philosophy quote the following verse from the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.29.21 ) to
prove that Kåñëa is just an ordinary man. Ahaà sarveñu bhüteñu
bhütätmävasthitaù sadä:  “The Supreme is presen t in every living entity.” We
should better take note of this particular verse from the Vaiñëava äcäryas  like
Jéva Gosvämé and Viçvanätha Cakravar té Öhäkura instead of following the
interpretation of unauthorized pers ons who deride Kåñëa. Jéva Gosvämé,
commenting on this verse, says that Kåñëa, in His plenary expansion asCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Paramätmä, is situated in the moving  and the nonmoving entities as the
Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the
arcä-mürti,  the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect
other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple.
There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the
lowest stage. The neophyte devot ee gives more attention to the Deit y in the
temple than to other devotees, so Vi çvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura warns that
this sort of mentality should be corre cted. A devotee should see that because
Kåñëa is present in everyone’s hear t as Paramätmä, every body is the
embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the
temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in
which the Paramätmä dwells. Everyone  should therefore be given proper
respect and should not be neglected.
There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say
that since God is everywhere, why sh ould one restrict himself to temple
worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity?
Although the personalist and the impe rsonalist will fight with one another
perpetually, a perfect devotee in Kåñë a consciousness knows that although
Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality, He is  all-pervading, as confirmed in the
Brahma-saàhitä . Although His personal abode is Goloka Våndävana and H e is
always staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His
plenary expansion He is present everywhe re in all parts of the material and
spiritual creation.

Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views.
In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities,
and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.
PURPORT
There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in Kåñëa
consciousness and devotional service bu t at heart do not accept the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, as the Absolute Truth. For them, the fruit of
devotional service—going back to Godhead—w ill never be tasted. Similarly,
those who are engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately
hoping to be liberated from this mate rial entanglement will never be successful
either, because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.  In
other words, persons who mock Kåñëa are to be understood to be demonic or
atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter  of Bhagavad-gétä,  such demonic
miscreants never surrender to Kåñëa. Therefore their mental speculations to
arrive at the Absolute T ruth bring them to the false conclusion that the
ordinary living entity and Kåñëa are one and the same. With such a false
conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply
covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this
material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to
become one with Kåñëa will be baffled be cause of delusion. Such atheistic and
demoniac cultivation of spiritual kno wledge is always futile. That is the
indication of th is verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Vedic literature, like the Vedänta-sütra  and the Upaniñads.  is always baffled.
It is a great offense, therefore, to consider Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality
o f  G o d h e a d ,  t o  b e  a n  o r d i n a r y  m a n .  Those who do so are certainly deluded
because they cannot understand the eternal form of Kåñëa. The
Båhad-viñëu-småti  clearly states:
yo vetti bhautikaà dehaà
kåñëasya paramätmanaù
sa sarvasmäd bahiñ-käryaù
çrauta-smärta-vidhänataù
mukhaà tasyävalokyäpi
sa-celaà snänam äcaret
“One who considers the body of Kåñëa to  be material should be driven out
from all rituals and activities of the çruti and the småti.  And if one by chance
sees his face, one should at once take  bath in the Ganges to rid himself of
infection. People jeer at Kåñëa because they are envious of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Their destiny is  certainly to take birth after birth in
the species of atheistic and demoniac life. Perpetually, their real knowledge
will remain under delusion, and gradually they will regress to the darkest
region of creation.”

In this verse the description of the mahätmä  is clearly given. The first sign
of the mahätmä  is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not
under the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is
explained in the Seventh Cha pter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, at once becomes freed from the control of
material nature. That is the qualific ation. One can become free from the
control of material nature as s oon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal
potency, as soon as the living entity  is freed from the control of material
nature, he is put under the guidance of  the spiritual nature. The guidance of
the spiritual natu re is called daivé prakåti,  divine nature. So when one is
promoted in that way—by surrender ing to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead—one attains to the stage of great soul, mahätmä.
The mahätmä  does not divert his attention to anything outside Kåñëa,
because he knows perfectly well that Kåñë a is the original Supreme Person, the
cause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a mahätmä,  or great soul,
develops through association  with other mahätmäs,  pure devotees. Pure
devotees are not even attracted by Kåñëa’s other features, such as the
four-armed Mahä-Viñëu. They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of
Kåñëa. They are not attracted to ot her features of Kåñëa, nor are the yCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They meditate
only upon Kåñëa in Kåñëa consciousne ss. They are always engaged in the
unswerving service of the Lord in Kåñëa consciousness.

PURPORT
The mahätmä  cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary
man. His symptoms are described here: a mahätmä  is always engaged in
chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead.
He has no other business. He is always engage d in the glorification of the Lord.
In other words, he is not an impersonal ist. When the question of glorification
is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, HisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.eternal form, His transcendental qualities and His uncommon pastim es. One
has to glorify all these things; therefore a mahätmä  is attached to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
One who is attached to the imperson al feature of the Supreme Lord, the
brahmajyoti,  is not described as mahätmä  in the Bhagavad-gétä.  He is described
in a different way in the next verse. The mahätmä  is always engaged in
different activities of devotional service, as described in the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  hearing and chanting about Viñëu, not a demigod or
human being. That is devotion: çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù  and smaraëam ,
remembering Him. Such a mahätmä  has firm determination to achieve at the
ultimate end t he association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five
transcendental rasas.  To achieve that success, he engages all
activities—mental, bodily and vocal, everything—in the service of the
Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa. That is called full Kåñëa consciousness.
In devotional service there are certain activities which are called
determined, such as fasting on certain da ys, like the eleventh day of the moon,
Ekädaçé, and on the appearance da y of the Lord. All these rules and
regulations are offered by the great äcäryas for those who are actually
interested in getting admission into th e association of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead in the transcendental world. The mahätmäs,  great souls, strictly
observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure  to achieve
the desired result.
As described in the second verse of this chapter, not only is this devotional
service easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to
undergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional
service, guided by an ex pert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a
householder or a sannyäsé  or a brahmacäré;  in any position and anywhere in
the world, he can perform this devotion al service to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and thus become actually mahätmä,  a great soul.

PURPORT
This verse is the summary of the previo us verses. The Lord tells Arjuna that
those who are purely in Kåñëa consciou sness and do not know anything other
than Kåñëa are called mahätmä;  yet there are other persons who are not
exactly in the position of mahätm ä but who worship Kåñëa also, in different
w a y s .  S o m e  o f  t h e m  h a v e  a l r e a d y  b een described as the distressed, the
financially destitute, the inquisitiv e, and those who are engaged in the
cultivation of knowledge. But there are others who are still lower, an d these
are divided into three: (1) he who worships himself as one with the Supreme
Lord, (2) he who concocts some form of  the Supreme Lord and worships that,
and (3) he who accepts the universal form, the viçvarüpa  of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, a nd worships that. Out of the above three, the lowest,
those who worship themselves as the Su preme Lord, thinking themselves to beCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.monists, are most predominant. Such people think themselves to be the
Supreme Lord, and in this me ntality they worship themsel ves. This is also a
type of God worship, for they can understand that they are not the material
body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent.
Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in this way. The
second class i ncludes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by
imagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the
third class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the
manifestation of this material universe. They consider the universe to be the
supreme organism or entity and worship that. The universe is also a form of
the Lord.

The Vedic sacrifice known as jyotiñöoma  is also Kåñëa, and He is also the
mahä-yajïa  mentioned in the småti.  The oblations offered to the Pitåloka or
the sacrifice performed to please the Pitå loka, considered as a kind of drug in
the form of clarified butt er, is also Kåñëa. The mantras  chanted in this
connection are also Kåñëa. And many other commodities made with milk
products for offering in the sacrifices are also Kåñëa. The fire is also Kåñëa
because fire is one of the five  material elements and is ther efore claimed as the
separated energy of Kåñëa. In other words, the Vedic sacrifices recommended
in the karma-käëòa  division of the Vedas  are in total also Kåñëa. Or, in other
words, those who are engaged in render ing devotional service unto Kåñëa are
to be understood to have performed all the sacrifices recommended in the
Vedas.

PURPORT
The entire cosmic manifestations, mo ving and nonmoving, are manifested
by different activities of Kåñëa’s ener gy. In the material existence we create
different relationships with different living entities who are nothing but
Kåñëa’s marginal energy; under the creation of prakåti  some of them appear as
our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts and
parcels of Kåñëa. As such, these living entities who appear to be our father,
mother, etc., are nothing but Kåñëa. In this verse the word dhätä  means
“creator.” Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of Kåñëa, but
the creator, grandmother and grandfather, etc., are also Kåñëa. Actually any
living entity, being part and parcel of Kåñëa, is Kåñëa. All the Vedas,  therefor e,
aim only toward Kåñëa. Whatever  we want to know through the Vedas  is but a
progressive step toward understanding Kåñëa. That subject matter which helps
us purify our constitutional position is especially Kåñëa. Similarly, the living
entity who is inquis itive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and
parcel of Kåñëa and as such is also Kåñëa. In all the Vedic mantras  the word
oà, called praëava,  is a transcendental sound vibration and is also Kåñëa. And
because in all the hymns of the four Vedas —Säma, Yajur, Åg  and
Atharva —the praëava,  or oàkära,  is very prominent, it is understood to be
Kåñëa.

I am the goal, the sustainer, the mast er, the witness, the abode, the refuge,

everything, the resting place and the eternal seed.
PURPORT
Gati  means the destination where we want  to go. But the ultimate goal is
Kåñëa, although people do not know  it. One who does not know Kåñëa is
misled, and his so-called progressive marc h is either partial or hallucinatory.
There are many who make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid
performance of the strict respective methods they reach different planets
known as Candraloka, Süryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc. But all such lokas,
or planets, being creations of Kåñëa, are simultaneously K åñëa and not Kåñëa.
Such planets, being manifestations of  Kåñëa’s energy, are also Kåñëa, but
actually they serve only as a step forward for realization of Kåñëa. To approach
the different energies of Kåñëa is to  approach Kåñëa indirectly. One should
direc tly approach Kåñëa, for that will save time and energy. For example, if
there is a possibility of going to the top of  a building by the help of an elevator,
why should one go by the staircase, st ep by step? Everything is resting on
Kåñëa’s energy; therefor e without Kåñëa’s shelter nothing can exist. Kåñëa isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything exists on
His energy. Kåñëa, being situated in ev eryone’s heart, is the supreme witness.
The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also Kåñëa. Kåñëa is
the ultimate goal of shelter, and theref ore one should take shelter of Kåñëa
either for protection or for annihilation  of his distress. And whenever we have
to take protection, we should know that our protection must be a l iving force.
Kåñëa is the supreme living entity. And since Kåñëa is the source of our
generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend than Kåñëa,
nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. Kå ñëa is the original source of creation
and the ulti mate rest after annihilation. Kåñëa is therefore the eternal cause of
all causes.

Kåñëa, by His different energies, diffu ses heat and light through the agency
of electricity and the sun. During summe r season it is Kåñëa who checks rain
from falling from the sky, and then duri ng the rainy season He gives unceasing
torrents of rain. The e nergy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of
our life is Kåñëa, and Kåñëa meets us at the end as death. By analyzing all these
different energies of Kåñëa, one can ascertain that for Kåñëa there is no
distinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words, He is both matter
and spirit. In the advanced stage of Kå ñëa consciousness, one therefore makes
no such distinctions. He sees only Kåñëa in everything.
Since Kåñëa is both matter and sp irit, the gigantic universal form
comprising all material manifestations  is also Kåñëa, and His pastimes in
Våndävana as two-handed Çyämasundara, playing on a flute, are those of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Those who study the Vedas and drink th e soma juice, seeking the heavenly
planets, worship Me indirectly. Purified of sinful reactions, they take birth on
the pious, heavenly planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights.
PURPORT
The word trai-vidyäù  refers to the three Vedas—Säma, Yajur  and Åg. A
brähmaëa  who has studied these three Vedas  is called a tri-vedé.  Anyone who is
very much attached to knowledge derived from these three Vedas  is respected
in society. Unfortunately, there  are many great scholars of the Vedas  who do
not know the ultimate purport of st udying them. Therefore Kåñëa herein
declares Himself to be the ultimate goal for the tri-vedés.  Actual tri-vedés  take
shelter under the lotus feet of  Kåñëa and engage in pure d evotional service to
satisfy the Lord. Devotional service be gins with the chanting of the Hare
Kåñëa mantra  and side by side trying to understand Kåñëa in truth.
Unfortunately those who are simply official students of the Vedas  become
more interested in of fering sacrifices to the different demigods like Indra and
Candra. By such endeavor, the worshipe rs of different demigods are certainly
purified of the contamination of the lo wer qualities of nature and are thereby
elevated to the higher planetary systems or heavenly planets known as
Maharloka, Janoloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once  situated on those higher planetary
systems, one can satisfy his senses hund reds of thousands of times better than
on this planet.

“Persons who are engaged in the worship of demigods are not very
intelligent, although such worship is offered to Me indirectly,” Kåñëa says. For
example, when a man pours water on the leaves and branches of a tree without
pouring water on the root, he doe s so without sufficient knowledge or without
observing regulative principles. Similarly, the process of rendering service to
different parts of the body is to supply food to the stomach. The demigods are,
so to speak, different officers and directors in th e government of the Supreme
Lord. One has to follow the laws made by the government, not by the officers
or directors. Similarly, everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord
only. That will automatically satisfy the different officers and director s of the
Lord. The officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the
government, and to offer some bribe to th e officers and directors is illegal. This
is stated here as avidhi-pürvakam.  In other words, Kåñëa does not approve the
unnecessary wor ship of the demigods.

Here it is clearly stated th at there are many types of yajïa  performances
recommended in the Vedic literatures, bu t actually all of them are meant for
satisfying the Supreme Lord. Yajïa  means Viñëu. In the Third Chapter of
Bhagavad-gétä  it is clearly state d that one should only work for satisfying
Yajïa, or Viñëu. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as
varëäçrama-dharma,  is specifically meant for satisfying Viñëu. Therefore,
Kåñëa says in this verse , “I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices becaus e I am the
supreme master.” Less intelligent person s, however, without knowing this fact,
worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material
existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has
any materi a l  d e s i r e  t o  b e  f u l f i l l e d ,  h e  h a d better pray for it to the Supreme

PURPORT
If one has any desire to go to the moon, the sun or any other planet, one
can attain the desired destination by  following specific Vedic principles
recommended for that purpose, such as the process technically known as
darça-paurëamäsé.  These are vividly d escribed in the fruitive activities portion
of the Vedas,  which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on
different heavenly planets. Similarly,  one can attain the Pitä planets by
performing a specific yajïa.  Similarly, one can go to many ghost ly planets and
become a Yakña, Rakña or Piçäca. Piçäca worship is called “black arts” or “black
magic.” There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it
is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a p ure
devotee, who worships the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead only, achieves the
planets of Vaikuëöha and Kåñëaloka without a doubt. It is very easy to
understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the
demigods one can achieve the hea venly planets, or by worshiping the Pitäs
achieve the Pitä planets, or by practi cing the black arts achieve the ghostly
planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of Kåñëa or Viñëu?
Unfortunately many people have no information of these subli me planets
where Kåñëa and Viñëu live, and because they do not know of them they fall
down. Even the impersonalists fall down from the brahmajyoti.  The KåñëaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.consciousness movement is therefore di stributing sublime information to the
entire human society t o the effect that by simply chanting the Hare Kåñëa
mantra  one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to
Godhead.

PURPORT
For the intelligent person, it is essential to be in Kåñëa consciousness,
engaged in the transcendental loving serv ice of the Lord, in order to achieve a
permanent, blissful abode for eternal happiness. The process of achieving such
a marvelous result is v ery easy and can be attempted even by the poorest of the
poor, without any kind of qualification. The only qualification required in thisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.connection is to be a pure devotee of the Lord. It does not matter what one is
or where one is situated. The process i s so easy that even a leaf or a little water
or fruit can be offered to the Supreme Lord in genuine love and the Lord will
be pleased to accept it. No one, therefore, can be barred from Kåñëa
consciousness, because it is so easy and universal. Who is such a fool that he
does not want to be Kåñëa conscious by this simple method and thus attain the
highest perfectional life of eternity, bliss and knowledge? Kåñëa wants only
loving service and nothing more. Kåñëa accepts even a little flower from His
pure devo tee. He does not want any kind of  offering from a nondevotee. He is
not in need of anything from anyone, because He is self-sufficient, and yet He
accepts the offering of His devotee in an exchange of love and affection. To
develop Kåñëa consciousness is t he highest perfection of life. Bhakti  is
mentioned twice in this verse in order to declare more emphatically that
bhakti,  or devotional service, is the only means to approach Kåñëa. No other
condition, such as becoming a brähmaëa.  a learned scholar, a very  rich man or
a great philosopher, can induce Kåñëa to accept some offering. Without the
basic principle of bhakti,  nothing can induce the Lord to agree to accept
anything from anyone. Bhakti  is never causal. The process is eternal. It is
direct action in s ervice to the absolute whole.
Here Lord Kåñëa, having establishe d that He is the only enjoyer, the
primeval Lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types
of sacrifices He desires to be offered.  If one wishes to engage in devotional
service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of
life—the transcendental loving servic e of God—then one should find out
what the Lord desires of him. One wh o loves Kåñëa will give Him whatever He
wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked. Thus
meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to Kåñëa. If He desired such things as
offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit,
flowers and water be given to Him, and He  says of this offering, “I will accept
it.” Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and
eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk an d water are the proper foods for human
beings and are prescribed by Lord Kåñë a Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot
be offered to Him, sin ce He will not accept it. Thus  we cannot be acting on theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.
In the Third Chapter, verse thirteen , Çré Kåñëa explains that only the
remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are
seeking advancement in life and releas e from the clutches of the material
entanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the
same verse, are eating only sin. In ot her words, their every mouthful is simply
deepening their involvement in the co mplexities of material nature. But
preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or
Deity of Lord Kåñëa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a
humble offering enables one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and
to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the
offering  should be made with an attitude of love. Kåñëa has no need of food,
since He already possesses everything th at be, yet He will accept the offering
of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in
preparation, in serving and in offer ing, is to act with love for Kåñëa.
The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute
Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-gétä.  To
them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of Kåñëa, the
speaker of the Bhagavad-gétä.  But, in actuality, Kåñëa, the Supreme Godhead,
has senses, and it is stated that His se nses are interchangeable; in other words,
one sense can perform the function of an y other. This is what it means to say
that Kåñëa is absolute. Lacking senses, He could ha rdly be considered full in all
opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, Kåñë a has explained that He impregnates
the living entities into material natu re. This is done by His looking upon
material nature. And so in this instance, Kåñëa’s hearing the devotee’s wor ds
of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly  identical with His eating and actually
tasting. This point should be emphasized : because of His absolute position, His
hearing is wholly identical with His eati ng and tasting. Only the devotee, who
accepts Kåñëa as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand
that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.

PURPORT
Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mo ld his life in such a way that he will
not forget Kåñëa in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance
of his body and soul together, and Kå ñëa recommends herein that one should
work for Him. Everyone has to  eat something to live; therefore he should
accept the remnants of foodstuffs offe red to Kåñëa. Any civilized man has to
perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore Kåñëa recommends,
“Do it for Me,” and this is called arcana.  Everyone has a te ndency to give
something in charity; Kåñëa says, “Give it to Me,” and this means that all
surplus money accumulated should be utilized in furthering the Kåñëa
consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the
meditational process, which  is not practical in this age, but if anyone practicesCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.meditating on Kåñëa twenty-four hour s a day by chanting the Hare Kåñëa

One who acts in Kåñëa consciousness under superior direction is called
yukta.  The technical term is yukta-vairagya.  This is further explained by Rüpa
Gosvämé as follows:
anäsaktasya viñayänCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.yathärham upayuïjataù
nirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe
yuktaà vairägyam ucyate
(Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  2.255 )
Rüpa Gosvämé says that as long as we are in this material world we have to
act; we cannot cease acting. Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits
are given to Kåñëa, then that is called yukta-vairägya.  Actually situated in
renunciation, such activi ties clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor
gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely
surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he
becomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified.  By this liberation he
does not become one with the brahmajyoti,  but rather enters into the planet of
the Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: mäm upaiñyasi,  “he comes to
Me,” back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation ,
and here it is specified that the devot ee who has always lived his lifetime here
under the direction of the Supreme Lord , as stated, has evolved to the point
where he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly
in the associatio n of the Supreme Lord.
Anyone who has no interest but to dedi cate his life to the service of the
Lord is actually a sannyäsé.  Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal
servant, dependent on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he
does, he does it for the be nefit of the Lord. Whatever  action he performs, he
performs it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the
fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas.  For ordinary
persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribe d duties mentioned in the
Vedas,  but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of
the Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties,
actually it is not so.
It is said, therefore, by Vaiñëava authorities that even the most intelligent
person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact
words are täìra väkya, kriyä, mudrä vijïeha nä bujhaya  (Caitanya-caritämåta,
Madhya  23.39 ). A perso n who is thus always engage d in the service of the Lord
or is always thinking and planning how to serve the Lord is to be consideredCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.completely liberated at present, and in the future his going back home, back to
Godhead, is guaranteed. He is above all mat erialistic criticism, just as Kåñëa is
above all criticism.

I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever

to him.
PURPORT
One may question here that if Kåñëa is  equal to everyone and no one is His
special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are
always engaged in His transcendental serv ice? But this is not discrimination; it
is natural. Any man  in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yetCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.he has a special interest in his own ch ildren. The Lord claims that every living
entity—in whatever form—is His son, an d so He provides everyone with a
generous supply of the necessities of life.  He is just like a cloud which pours
rain all over, regardless of whether it falls  on rock or land or water. But for His
devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they
are always in Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore they are  always
transcendentally situated in Kåñëa. The very phrase “Kåñëa consciousness”
suggests that those who are in such cons ciousness are living transcendentalists,
s i t u a t e d  i n  H i m .  T h e  L o r d  s a y s  h e r e  d i s t i n c t l y ,  mayi te:  “They are in Me.”
Naturally, as a re sult, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also
explains the words ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham :
“Whoever surrenders unto Me, proporti onately I take care of him.” This
transcendental reciprocation exists because both th e Lord and the devotee are
conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold
is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the
living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes incli ned to the
service of the Supreme Lord he looks li ke gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so
this combination is very nice. Living  entities in a pure state are called
devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a
reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then
there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no
reciprocation between the Supreme an d the living entity, but in the
personalist philosophy there is.
The example is often given that the Lord  is like a desire tree, and whatever
one wants from this desire tree, the Lo rd supplies. But here the explanation is
more complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is
the manifestation of the Lord’s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord’s
reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma.  It
belongs to the transcendental situatio n in which the Lord and His devotees
function. Devotional service to  the Lord is not an activ ity of this material
world; it is part of the spiritual wo rld, where eternity, bliss and knowledge
predominate.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  30

TRANSLATION
Even if one commits the most abominable action, if he is engaged in
devotional service he is to be considered  saintly because he is properly situated
in his determination.
PURPORT
The word su-duräcäraù  used in this verse is very significant, and we should
understand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds
of activities: one is conditional, an d the other is constitutional. As for
protecting the body or abid ing by the rules of society and state, certainly there
are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the
conditional life, and such activities ar e called conditional. Besides these, the
living entity who is fully conscious of his spir itual nature and is engaged in
Kåñëa consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities whichCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional
position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now , in the
conditioned state, sometimes devotional  service and the conditional service in
relation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these
activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very
cautious  s o  t h a t  h e  d o e s  n o t  d o  a n y t h i n g  that could disrupt his wholesome
condition. He knows that perfection  in his activities depends on his
progressive realization of Kåñëa consci ousness. Sometimes, however, it may be
seen that a person in Kåñëa consciousness c ommits some act which may be
taken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown
does not disqualify him. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is stated that if a person
falls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental serv ice of the
Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, purifies him and
excuses him from that abomination. Th e material contamination is so strong
that even a yogé fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes
ensnared; but Kåñëa consciousness is so strong that such an occasional
falldown is at once rectified. Therefor e the process of devotional service is
always a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown
from the ideal path, for, as explained in the nex t verse, such occasional
falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely
situated in Kåñëa consciousness.
Therefore a person who is situated in  Kåñëa consciousness and is engaged
with determination in the process of ch anting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa
Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare should be
considered to be in the transcendent al position, even if by chance or accident
he is found to have fallen. The words sädhur eva,  “he is saintly,” are very
emphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an
accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still b e
considered saintly even if he has accidentally fallen down. And the word
mantavyaù  is still more emphatic. If one does  not follow this rule, and derides a
devotee for his accidental falldown, then  one is disobeying the order of the
Supreme Lord. The only  qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and
exclusively engaged in devotional service.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.In the Nåsiàha Puräëa  the following statement is given:
bhagavati ca haräv ananya-cetä
bhåça-malino ’pi viräjate manuñyaù
na hi çaça-kaluña-cchabiù kadäcit
timira-paräbhavatäm upaiti candraù
The meaning is that even if one fully  engaged in the devotional service of
the Lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable activities, these activities
should be considered to be like the sp ots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on
the moon. Such spots d o not become an impediment to the diffusion of
moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of
saintly character does not make him abominable.
On the other hand, one should no t misunderstand that a devotee in
transcendental devotional service can ac t in all kinds of abominable ways; this
verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material
connections. Devotional service is more o r less a declaration of war against the
illusory energy. As long as one is no t strong enough to fight the illusory
energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is strong enough, he
is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explaine d. No one
should take advantage of this verse an d commit nonsense and think that he is
still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by devotional service,
then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee.

PURPORT
This should not be misunderstood. In the Seventh Chapter the Lord says
that one who is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of
the Lord. One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications
whatsoever . The question remains, then, How can a person engaged in
abominable activities—either by accident  or by intention—be a pure devotee?
This question may justly be raised. Th e miscreants, as stated in the Seventh
Chapter, who never come to the devoti onal service of the Lord, have n o good
qualifications, as is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  Generally, a devotee who
is engaged in the nine kinds of devotion al activities is engaged in the process
of cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme
Personality o f Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are
naturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him
pure by nature. According to the Vedas,  there is a certain regulation that if
one falls down from his exalted position he  has to undergo certain ritualistic
processes to purify himself. But here there is no such condition, because the
purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his
remembering the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead constantly. Therefor e, the
chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,
Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare sh ould be continued without stoppage.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.This will protect a devotee from all a ccidental falldowns. He will thus remain
perpetually free from all mat erial contaminations.

It is clearly declared here by the Su preme Lord that in devotional service
there is no distinction between the lowe r and higher classes of people. In the
material conception of life there are su ch divisions, but for a person engaged in
transcendental devot ional service to the Lord there are not. Everyone is
eligible for the supreme destination. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (2.4.18 ) it isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.stated that even the lowest, who are called caëòälas  (dog-eaters), can be
purified by association with a pure devotee. Theref ore devotional service and
the guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination
between the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most
simple man taking shelter of the pure devotee can be purified by proper
guidance. According to the different modes of material nature, men are
classified in the mode of goodness ( brähmaëas ), the mode of passion ( kñatriyas,
or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance ( vaiçyas,  or
merchants), and the mode of ignora nce ( çüdras,  or workers). Those lower than
them are called caëòälas,  and they are born in sinful families. Generally, the
association of those born in sinful fa milies is not accepted by the higher
classes. But the process of devotional service is so strong  that the pure devotee
of the Supreme Lord can enable people of all the lower classes to attain the
highest perfection of life. This is possi ble only when one takes shelter of Kåñëa.
As indicated here by the word vyapäçritya,  one has to take shelter comple tely
of Kåñëa. Then one can become much greater than great jïänés  and yogés.

How much more this is so of the righ teous brähmaëas, the devotees and the
saintly kings. Therefore, having come to this temporary, miserable world,
engage in loving service unto Me.
PURPORT
In this material world there are classifi cations of people, but, after all, this
world is not a happy place for anyone. It is clearly stated here, anityam
asukhaà lokam:  this world is temporary and full of miseries, not habitable for
any sane gentleman. Th is world is declared by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead to be temporary and full of miseries. Some philosophers, especially
Mäyävädé philosophers, say that this worl d is false, but we can understand from
Bhagavad-gétä  that the world is not false; it is temporary. There is a difference
between temporary and false. This worl d is temporary, but there is another
world, which is eternal. This world is miserable, but the other world is eternal
and blissful.
Arjuna was born in a saintly royal family. To him also the Lord says, “ Take
to My devotional service and come quickly back to Godhead, back home .” No
one should remain in this temporary world, full as it is with miseries. Everyone
should attach himself to the bosom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so
that he can be eternally happy. The devotional service of the Supreme Lord is
the only process  by which all problems of all classes of men can be solved.
Everyone should therefore take to Kåñëa consciousne ss and make his life
perfect.

PURPORT
In this verse it is clearly indicated that Kåñëa consciousness is the only
means of being delivered from the clut ches of this contaminated material
world. Sometimes unscrupulous comment ators distort the meaning of what is
clearly stated here: that all devo tional service should be offered to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Unfortunately, unscrupulous
commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible.
Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between Kå ñëa’s
mind and Kåñëa. Kåñëa is not an ordina ry human being; He is Absolute Truth.
His body, His mind and He Himself are on e and absolute. It is stated in the
Kürma Puräëa.  as it is quoted by Bhaktisi ddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé in his
Anubhäñya  comments on Caitanya-caritämåta  (Fifth Chapter, Ädi-lélä,  verses
41–48 ), deha-dehi-vibhedo ’yaà neçvare vidyate kvacit.  This means that there is
no difference in Kåñëa, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But
because the commentators do not know this science  of Kåñëa, they hide KåñëaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is
sheer ignorance of the science of Kå ñëa, some men make profit out of
misleading people.
There are some who are demonic; they also think of Kåñëa, but enviously,
just like King Kaàsa, Kåñëa’s uncle. He was also thinking of Kåñëa always, but
he thought of Kåñëa as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when
Kåñëa would come to kill him.  That kind of thinking will not help us. One
should be thinking of Kåñëa in devotional love. That is bhakti.  One should
cultivate the knowledge of Kåñëa cont inuously. What is that favorable
cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. Kåñëa is the  Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is
not material, but is eternal, blissful kn owledge. This kind of talk about Kåñëa
will help one become a devotee. Understanding Kåñëa otherwise, from the
wrong source, will  prove fruitless.
One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form
of Kåñëa; with conviction in his heart that Kåñëa is the Supreme, he should
engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in
India for the worship of Kåñëa, a nd devotional service is practiced there.
When such practice is made, one has to  offer obeisances to Kåñëa. One should
lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his
activities—everything. That will make one fully absorbed in Kåñëa with out
deviation. This will help one transfer  to the Kåñëaloka. One should not be
deviated by unscrupulous commentat ors. One must engage in the nine
different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting
about Kåñëa. Pure devotional se rvice is the highest achievement of human
society.
The Seventh and Eighth chapters of Bhagavad-gétä  have explained pure
devotional service to the Lord that is  free from speculative knowledge, mystic
yoga and fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be
attracted by different features of the Lord like the impersonal brahmajyoti  and
localized Paramätmä, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the
Supreme Lord.
There is a beautiful poem about Kåñëa in which it is clearly stated that anyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.person who is engaged in the worship of  demigods is most unintelligent and
cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of Kåñëa. The devotee, in the
beginning, may sometimes fall  from the standard, but still he should be
considered superior to all other philosophers and yogés.  One who always
engages in Kåñëa consciousness should be  understood to be a perfectly saintly
person. His accidental nondevot ional activities will diminish, and he will soon
be situated without any doubt in comple te perfection. The pure devotee has no
actual chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes
care of His pure devotees. Therefore,  the intelligent person should take
directly to the  process of Kåñëa consciousness and happily live in this material
world. He will eventually receive the supreme award of Kåñëa.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Ninth Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of the Most Confidential Knowledge.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Listen again, O mighty-armed
Arjuna. Because you are My dear friend, for your benefit I shall speak to you
further, giving knowledge that is bette r than what I have already explained.
PURPORT
The word bhagavän  is explained thus by Paräçara Muni: one who is full in
six opulences, who has full strength, fu ll fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and
renunciation, is Bhagavän, or the Su preme Personality of Godhead. While
Kåñëa was present on this earth,  He displayed all six opulences. Therefore
great sages like Paräçara Muni have all accepted Kåñëa as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Now Kåñëa is in structing Arjuna in more confidential
knowledge of His opulences and His work. Previously, beginning wit h the
Seventh Chapter, the Lord has already explained His different energies and
how they are acting. Now in this chapte r He explains His specific opulences to
Arjuna. In the previous chapter He has clearly explained His different
energies to establish dev otion in firm conviction. Again in this chapter He
tells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences.
The more one hears about the Suprem e God, the more one becomes fixed
in devotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the
association of devotees; that will enhanc e one’s devotional service. DiscoursesCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.in the society of devotees can take pla ce only among those who are really
anxious to be in Kåñëa consciousness. Others cannot take part in such
discourses. The Lord clearly tells Arjuna that because Arjuna is very dear to
Him, for his benefit such discourses are taking place.

Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin or

PURPORT
As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä,  Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord. No one
is greater than Him; He is the cause of a ll causes. Here it is also stated by the
Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the
demigods and great sages cannot understand Kåñëa; they can understand
neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-calledCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.s c h o l a r s  o f  t h i s  t i n y  p l a n e t ?  N o  o n e can understand why this Supreme God
comes to earth as an ordinary  human being and executes such  wonderful,
uncommon activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the
qualification necessary to understand Kå ñëa. Even the demigods and the great
sages have tried to understand Kåñëa by their mental speculation, and they
have failed to do so . In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also it is clearly said that even
the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. They can speculate to the limi ts of their imperfect senses and can
reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism , of something not manifested
by the three qualities of material na ture, or they can imagine something by
mental speculation, but it is not possibl e to understand Kåñëa by such foolish
speculation.
Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute
Truth, “Here I am present as the Supr eme Personality of Godhead. I am the
Supreme.” One should know this. Al though one cannot understand the
inconceivable Lord who is personally presen t, He nonetheless exists. We can
actually understand Kåñëa, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply
by studying His words in Bhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  The
conception of God as some ruling powe r or as the impersonal Brahman can be
reached by persons who are in the infe rior energy of the Lord, but the
Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the
transcendental position.
Because most men cannot understand Kåñëa in His actual situation, out of
His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite
the Supreme Lord’s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to
contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman
is the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme
Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is
Kåñëa. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal  Brahman
conception of God; their faith an d devotion bring them to surrender
immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Kåñëa
they can understand Kåñëa. No one else  can understand Him. So even great
sages agree: What is ätmä,  what  i s  t h e  S u p r e m e ?  I t  i s  H e  w h o m  w e  h a v e  t oCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.worship.

TRANSLATION
He who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord
of all the worlds—he only, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins.
PURPORT
As stated in the Seventh Chapter ( 7.3), manuñyäëäà sahasreñu kaçcid yatati
siddhaye:  those who are trying to elevat e themselves to the platform of
spiritual realization are not ordinary me n; they are superior to millions and
millions of ordinary men who ha ve no knowledge of spiritual realization. But
out of those actually trying to unders tand their spiritual situation, one who
can come to the understanding that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the proprietor of ever ything, the unborn, is the mos t successful
spiritually realized person. In that st age only, when one has fully understoodCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Kåñëa’s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions.
Here the Lord is described by the word aja, meaning “unborn,” but He is
distinct from the living entities who are described in the Second Chapter as
aja. The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and
dying due to material attachme nt. The conditioned souls are changing their
bodies, but His body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material
world, He comes as the same unborn; ther efore in the Fourth Chapter it is said
that the Lord, by His internal  potency, is not under the  inferior, material
energy, but is always in the superior energy.
In this verse the words vetti loka-maheçvaram  indicate that one should know
that Lord Kåñëa is the supreme proprietor of the planetary systems of the
universe. He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His
creation. All the demigods wer e created within this material world, but as far
as Kåñëa is concerned, it is said that  He is not created; therefore Kåñëa is
different even from the great demigods  like Brahmä and Çiva. And because He
is the creator of Brahmä, Çiva and all the other demig ods, He is the Supreme
Person of all planets.
Çré Kåñëa is therefore different from ev erything that is created, and anyone
who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful
reactions. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the
knowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by  devotional service can He be known
and not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä.
One should not try to understand Kåñëa as a human being. As stated
previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again
expressed here in a different way. A ma n who is not foolish, who is intelligent
enough to understand the cons titutional position of the Godhead, is always
free from all sinful reactions.
If Kåñëa is known as the son of Deva ké, then how can He be unborn? That
is also explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam : When He appeared before Devaké
and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His
original form, and then He transformed Him self into an ordinary child.
Anything done under the direction of Kåñëa is transcendental. It cannot be
contaminated by material reactions, wh ich may be auspicious or inauspicious.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the
material world is more or less a  mental concoction because there is nothing
auspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very
material nature is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real
auspiciousness depends on activities in Kåñëa consciousne ss in full devotion
and service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious, then we
should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are
given in authoritative scriptures such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam  and
Bhagavad-gétä,  or from a bona fide spiritual master. Because the spiritual
master is the representative of the Supr eme Lord, his direction is directly the
direction of the Supreme Lord. The sp iritual master, saintly persons and
scriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in these three
sources. All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of
pious or impious activities of this mate rial world. The transcendental attitude
of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that o f renunciation,
and this is called sannyäsa.  As stated in the first verse of the Sixth Chapter  of
Bhagavad-gétä,  one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to
do so by the Supreme Lord, and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his
activities ( anäçritaù karma-phalam ), is a true renouncer. Anyone acting under
the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyäsé  and a yogé, and not the
man who has simply taken the dress of the sannyäsé,  or a pseudo yogé.

Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness,
truthfulness, control of the senses, control of the mind, happiness and distress,
birth, death, fear, fearlessness, nonvio lence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity,
charity, fame and i nfamy—all these various qualities of living beings are created
by Me alone.
PURPORT
The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created
by Kåñëa, and they are described here.
Intelligence refers to the power to  analyze things in their proper
perspective, and knowledge refers to un derstanding what is spirit and what is
matter. Ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only
to matter, and it is not accepted h ere as knowledge. Knowledge meansCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.knowing the distinction between spirit and matter. In modern education there
is no knowledge about spirit; they are simply taking care of the material
elements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete .
Asammoha,  freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is
not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly
but surely he becomes free from bewi lderment. Nothing should be accepted
blindly; everything should be accepte d with care and with caution. Kñamä,
tolerance and forgiveness, should be pr acticed; one should be tolerant and
excuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam,  truthfulness, means that facts
should be presented as they are, for the benefit of others. Facts sh ould not be
misrepresented. According to social conven tions, it is said that one can speak
the truth only when it is palatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The
truth should be spoken in a straightforw ard way, so that others will understand
actually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he
is a thief, that is truth. Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one
should not refrain from speaking it. Truthfulness demands that the facts be
presented as they are for the benefit of others. That is the definition of truth.
Control of the senses means that th e senses should not be used for
unnecessary personal enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the
proper needs of the senses, but unnecessa ry sense enjoyment is detrimental for
spiritual advancement. Therefore t he senses should be restrained from
unnecessary use. Similarly, one should  restrain the mind from unnecessary
thoughts; that is called çama.  One should not spend one’s time pondering over
earning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind shou ld be
used to understand the prime necessity  of human beings, and that should be
presented authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in
association with persons who are authorit ies in the scriptures, saintly persons
and spiritual masters an d those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham,
pleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the
cultivation of the spiritual knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness. And similarly,
that which is painful or which causes distress is t hat which is unfavorable for
the cultivation of Kåñëa consciousn ess. Anything favorable for the
development of Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted, and anythingCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.unfavorable should be rejected.
Bhava,  birth, should be understood to refe r to the body. As far as the soul is
concerned, there is neither birth nor de ath; that we have discussed in the
beginning of Bhagavad-gétä.  Birth and death apply to one’s embodiment in the
material world. Fear is d ue to worrying about the future. A person in Kåñëa
consciousness has no fear because by his ac tivities he is sure to go back to the
spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhea d. Therefore his future is very bright.
Others, however, do not know what their futu re holds; they have no
knowledge of what the next life hold s. So they are therefore in constant
anxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to
understand Kåñëa and be situated always  in Kåñëa consciousness. In that way
we will be free from all fear. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.2.37 ) it is stated,
bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät:  fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory
energy. But those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are
confident that they are not the ma terial body, that they are spiritual parts of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who are therefore engaged in the
transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their
future is very bright. This fear  is a condition of persons who  are not in Kåñëa
consciousness. Abhayam,  fearlessness, is possible only for one in Kåñëa
consciousness.
Ahiàsä,  nonviolence, means that one sh ould not do anything which will
put others into misery or confusion. Mate rial activities that are promised by so
many politicians, sociologists, philanth ropists, etc., do not produce very good
results because the polit icians and philanthropists have no transcendental
vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahiàsä
means that people should be trained in  such a way that the full utilization of
the human body can be achieved. The human body i s meant for spiritual
realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that
end commit violence on the human bo dy. That which furthers the future
spiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.
Samatä,  equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be
very much attached or to be very much  detached is not the best. This material
world should be accepted without attachment or aversion. That which isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.favorable for prosecuting Kåñëa c onsciousness should be accepted; that which
is unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samatä,  equanimity. A person
in Kåñëa consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept save in
terms of its usefulness in the prosecution of Kåñëa consci ousness.
Tuñöi,  satisfaction, means that one should  not be eager to gather more and
more material goods by unnecessary ac tivity. One should be satisfied with
whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called
satisfaction. Tapas  means austerity o r penance. There are many rules and
regulations in the Vedas  which apply here, like rising early in the morning and
taking a bath. Sometimes it is very tr oublesome to rise early in the morning,
but whatever voluntary trouble on e may suffer in this way is c alled penance.
Similarly, there are prescriptions for fast ing on certain days of the month. One
may not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination
to make advancement in the science of Kåñëa consciousness, he should accept
such bodily troubles when they are recommended. However, one should not
fast unnecessarily or against Vedic inju nctions. One should not fast for some
political purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-gétä  as fasting in ignorance,
and anything done in ignorance o r passion does not lead to spiritual
advancement. Everything done in th e mode of goodness does advance one,
however, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in
spiritual knowledge.
As far as charity is concerned, one sh ould give fifty percent of his earnings
to some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in
terms of Kåñëa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but the best cause.
Because Kåñëa is g ood, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be given to a
person who is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness. According to Vedic literature,
it is enjoined that charit y should be given to the brähmaëas.  This practice is
still followed, although not very nic ely in terms of the Vedic injunction. But
still the injunction is that ch arity should be given to the brähmaëas.  Why?
Because they are engaged in higher cu ltivation of spiritual knowledge. A
brähmaëa  is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Br ahman.
Brahma jänätéti brähmaëaù:  one who knows Brahman is called a brähmaëa.
Thus charity is offered to the brähmaëas  because they are always engaged inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.higher spiritual service and have no time  to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic
literature, charity i s also to be awarded to one in the renounced order of life,
the sannyäsé.  The sannyäsés  beg from door to door, not for money but for
missionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken
the householders from the slumber of ignorance.  Because the householders are
engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in
life—awakening their Kåñëa consciousness—it is the business of the sannyäsés
to go as beggars to the householde rs and encourage them to be Kåñëa
conscious. A s it is said in the Vedas,  one should awake and achieve what is due
him in this human form of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by
the sannyäsés;  hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the
brähmaëas,  and similar good causes,  not to any whimsical cause.
Yaças,  fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is
famous when he is known as a great de votee. That is real fame. If one has
become a great man in Kåñëa consciousness and it is known, then he is truly
famous. One who does not have su ch fame is infamous.
All these qualities are manifest throug hout the universe in human society
and in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on
other planets, and these qualities ar e there. Now, for one who wants to
advance in Kåñëa consciousness, Kåñëa creates all these qualities, but the
person develops them himself from wi thin. One who engages in the devotional
service of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the
Supreme Lord.
Of whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Kåñëa. Nothing can
manifest itself in this material world wh ich is not in Kåñëa. That is knowledge;
although we know that things are diffe rently situated, we should realize that
everything flows from Kåñëa.

The seven great sages and before them  the four other great sages and the

the living beings populating the various planets descend from them.
PURPORT
The Lord is giving a genealogical sy nopsis of the universal population.
Brahmä is the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme Lord,
who is known as Hiraëyagarbha. And from Brahmä all the seven great sages,
and before them four other great s ages, named Sanaka, Sananda, Sanätana and
Sanat-kumära, and the Manus, are manifested. All these twenty-five great
sages are known as the patriarchs of the living entities all over the universe.
There are innumerable universes and innumerable planets withi n each
universe, and each planet is full of population of different varieties. All of
them are born of these twenty-five patriarchs. Brahmä underwent penance for
one thousand years of the demigods befo re he realized by the grace of Kåñëa
how to create. The n from Brahmä came Sanaka, Sananda, Sanätana and
Sanat-kumära, then Rudra, and then the seven sages, and in this way all the
brähmaëas  and kñatriyas  are born out of the energy of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Brahmä is known as Pitämaha, the grandfat her, and Kåñëa isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.known as Prapitämaha , the father of the grandfather. That is stated in the

One who is factually convinced of this opulence and mystic power of Mine

PURPORT
The highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Unless one is  firmly convinced of the different
opulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service.
Generally people know that God is great, b ut they do not know in detail how
God is great. Here are the details. If one knows factually how God is great,
then naturally he becomes a surrender ed soul and engages himself in the
devotional service of the Lord. When  one factually knows the opulences of  theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Supreme, there is no alternative but to surrender to Him. This factual
knowledge can be known from the descriptions in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  and
Bhagavad-gétä  and similar literatures.
In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed
throughout the planetary system, and th e chief of them are Brahmä, Lord Çiva
and the four great Kumäras and the other patriarchs. There are many
forefathers of the population of the  universe, and all of them are born of the
Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. The Supreme Pers onality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the
original forefather of all forefathers.
These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is firmly
convinced of them, he accepts Kåñëa with great faith and without any doubt,
and he engages in devotional service. A ll this particular knowledge is required
in order to increase one’s i nterest in the loving devoti onal service of the Lord.
One should not neglect to understand fully how great Kåñëa is, for by knowing
the greatness of Kåñëa one will be able to be fixed in sincere devotional
service.

I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates
from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service
and worship Me with all their hearts.
PURPORT
A learned scholar who has studied the Vedas  perfectly and has information
from authorities like Lord Caitanya  and who knows how to apply these
teachings can understand that Kåñëa is the origin of everything in both the
material and spiritual worlds, and be cause he knows this perfectly he becomes
firmly fixed in the devotional servic e of the Supreme Lord. He can never be
deviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic
literature agrees that Kåñëa is the source of Brahmä, Çiva and al l other
demigods. In the Atharva Veda  (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.24) it is said, yo
brahmäëaà vidadhäti pürvaà yo vai vedäàç ca gäpayati sma kåñëaù:  “It was
Kåñëa who in the beginning instructed  Brahmä in Vedic knowledge and who
disseminated Vedic knowledge  in the past.” Then again the Näräyaëa
Upaniñad  (1) says, atha puruño ha vai näräyaëo ’kämayata prajäù såjeyeti:  “Then
the Supreme Personality Näräyaëa desire d to create living entities.” The
Upaniñad  continues, näräyaëäd brahmä jäyate, näräyaëäd prajäpati ù prajäyate,
näräyaëäd indro jäyate, näräyaëäd añöau vasavo jäyante, näräyaëäd ekädaça
rudrä jäyante, näräyaëäd dvädaçädityäù:  “From Näräyaëa, Brahmä is born, and
from Näräyaëa the patriarchs are also born. From Näräyaëa, Indra is born,
from Näräyaëa the e ight Vasus are born, from Närä yaëa the eleven Rudras are
born, from Näräyaëa the twelve Ädit yas are born.” This Näräyaëa is an
expansion of Kåñëa.
It is said in the same Vedas,  brahmaëyo devaké-putraù:  “The son of Devaké,
Kåñëa, is the Supreme Personality.” ( Näräyaëa Upaniñad  4) Then it is said, eko
vai näräyaëa äsén na brahmä na éçäno näpo nägni-samau neme dyäv-äpåthivé na
nakñaträëi na süryaù:  “In the beginning of the creation there was only the
Supreme Personality Näräyaëa. There was no Brahmä, no Çiva, no water, noCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.fire, no moon, no stars in the sky, no sun.” ( Mahä Upaniñad  1) In the Mahä
Upaniñad  it is also said that Lord  Ç i v a  w a s  b o r n  f r o m  t h e  f orehead of the
Supreme Lord. Thus the Vedas  say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of
Brahmä and Çiva, who is to be worshiped.
In the Mokña-dharma  Kåñëa also says,
prajäpatià ca rudraà cäpy
aham eva såjämi vai
tau hi mäà na vijänéto
mama mäyä-vimohitau
“The patriarchs, Çiva and others are created by Me, though they do not
know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory
energy.” In the Varäha Puräëa  it is also said,
näräyaëaù paro devas
tasmäj jätaç caturmukhaù
tasmäd rudro ’bhavad devaù
sa ca sarva-jïatäà gataù
“Näräyaëa is the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead, and from Him Brahmä
was born, from whom Çiva was born.”
Lord Kåñëa is the source of all ge nerations, and He is called the most
efficient cause of everything. He says,  “Because everything is born of Me, I am
the original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.” There
is no supreme controller o ther than Kåñëa. One who understands Kåñëa in
such a way from a bona fide spiritual master, with references from Vedic
literature, engages all his energy in Kåñëa consciousness and becomes a truly
learned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not k now Kåñëa
properly, are but fools. Only a fool would consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary
man. A Kåñëa conscious person should no t be bewildered by fools; he should
avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on Bhagavad-gétä  and
proceed in Kåñëa c onsciousness with determination and firmness.

TRANSLATION
The thoughts of My pure devotees dwe ll in Me, their lives are fully devoted
to My service, and they derive great satisfaction and bliss from always
enlightening one another and conversing about Me.
PURPORT
Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves
fully in the transcendental loving se rvice of the Lord. Their minds cannot be
diverted from the lotus feet of Kå ñëa. Their talks are solely on the
transcendental subjects. The sympt oms of the pure devotees are described in
this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours
daily engaged in glorifying the qualit ies and pastimes of the Supreme Lord.
Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in Kåñëa, and they take
pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.
In the preliminary stage of devo tional service they relish theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.transcendental pleasure from the servic e itself, and in the mature stage they
are actually situated in love of God.  Once situated in that transcendental
position, they can relish the highest pe rfection which is exhibited by the Lord
in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens tr anscendental devotional service to the
sowing of a seed in the heart of the li ving entity. There are innumerable living
entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of
them there are a few who are fortunate en ough to meet a pure devotee and get
the chance to understand devotional se rvice. This devotional service is just
like a seed, and if it is sown in the he art of a living entity, and if he goes on
hearing and chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare
Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed
of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional
service gradually grows a nd grows until it penetrates the covering of the
material universe and enters into the brahmajyoti  effulgence in the spiritual
sky. In the spiritual sky also that plan t grows more and more until it reaches
the highest planet, which is called Goloka Våndäva na, the supreme planet of
Kåñëa. Ultimately, the plant takes shel ter under the lotus feet of Kåñëa and
rests there. Gradually, as a plant grow s fruits and flowers, that plant of
devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of
chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully
described in the Caitanya-caritämåta  (Madhya-lélä,  Chapter Nineteen ). It is
explained there that when the complete  plant takes shelter under the lotus
feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he
cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme
Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee
actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact wit h the Supreme Lord.
The Çrémad-Bhägavatam  is also full of such narrations about the
relationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees ; therefore the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  is very dear to the devotees, as stated in the Bhägavatam
itself ( 12.13.18 ). Çrémad-bhägavataà puräëam a malaà yad vaiñëavänäà priyam.
In this narration there is nothing about material activities, economic
development, sense gratification or liberation. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  is the only
narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and HisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.devo tees is fully described. Thus the real ized souls in Kåñëa consciousness take
continual pleasure in hearing such transc endental literatures, just as a young
boy and girl take pleasure in association.

PURPORT
In this verse the word buddhi-yogam  is very significant. We may remember
that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had
spoken to him of many things and that  He would instruct him in the way of
buddhi-yoga.  Now buddhi-yoga  is exp lained. Buddhi-yoga  itself is action in
Kåñëa consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi  means
intelligence, and yoga means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When oneCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to Kåñëa consci ousness
in devotional service, his action is called buddhi yoga.  In other words,
buddhi-yoga  is the process by which one gets  out of the entanglement of this
material world. The ultimate goal of progress is Kåñëa. People do not know
this; therefore the ass ociation of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are
important. One should know that the goal is Kåñëa, and when the goal is
assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate
goal is achieved.
When a person knows the goal of life  but is addicted to the fruits of
activities, he is acting in karma-yoga.  When he knows that the goal is Kåñëa
but he takes pleasure in mental speculat ions to understand Kåñëa, he is acting
in jïäna-yoga.  A n d  w h e n  h e  k n o ws the goal and seeks Kåñëa completely in
Kåñëa consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga,  or
buddhi-yoga,  which is the complete yoga.  This complete yoga is the highest
perfectional stage of life.
A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a
spiritual organization, but still, if he is  not intelligent enough to make progress,
then Kåñëa from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come
to Him without difficu lty. The qualification is that a person always engage
himself in Kåñëa consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of
services. He should perform some sort of work for Kåñëa, and that work should
be with love. If a devotee is not intelligent enough to make progress on the
path of self-realization but is sincere and devoted to the activities of
devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and
ultimately attain to Him.

PURPORT
When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare
Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma
Räma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prakäçänanda
Sarasvaté, a very influential and learned schola r in Benares at that time,
derided Lord Caitanya  for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers
criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the
darkness of ignorance and are philosophi cally naive sentimentalists. Actually
that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put
forward the philosophy of devotion. But even if a devotee does not take
advantage of their literatures or of his sp iritual master, if he is sincere in his
devotional service he is he lped by Kåñëa Himself within his heart. So the
sincere devotee engaged in Kåñëa consciousness cannot be without knowledge.
The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full Kåñëa
consciousness.
The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot
h a v e  p u r e  k n o w l e d g e .  F o r  t h e m  t h i s  answer is given by the Supreme Lord:
those who are engaged in pure devoti onal service, even though they beCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.without sufficient education and even without  sufficient knowledge of the
Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.
The Lord tells Arjuna that basically th ere is no possibility of understanding
the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth,  the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
simply by speculating, for the Supreme Tr uth is so great that it is not possible
to understand Him or t o achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man
can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if
he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand Kåñëa, or the
Supreme Truth. Only by devotional service i s the Supreme Truth, Kåñëa,
pleased, and by His inconceivable energy  He can reveal Himself to the heart of
the pure devotee. The pure devotee always has Kåñëa within his heart; and
with the presence of Kåñëa, who is just like the sun, the darkness of ignor ance
is at once dissipated. This is the spec ial mercy rendered to the pure devotee by
Kåñëa.
Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many
millions of births, one’s heart is always  covered with the dust of materialism,
but when one engages in devotional serv ice and constantly chants Hare Kåñëa,
the dust quickly clears, and o ne is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge.
The ultimate goal, Viñëu, can be attained only by this chant and by devotional
service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not
have to worry about the material necessities of l ife; he need not be anxious,
because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided
automatically by the Supreme Lord, who is pleased by the loving devotional
service of the devotee. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-gét ä. By
studying Bhagavad-gétä,  one can become a soul completely surrendered to the
Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord
takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic
endeavors.

In these two verses the Supreme Lo rd gives a chance to the modern
philosopher, for here it is clear that  the Supreme is different from the
individual soul. Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gétä
[BG. 10.8-11]  in this chapter, beca me completely free from all doubts and
accepted Kåñëa as the Supreme Personal ity of Godhead. He at once boldly
declares, “You are paraà brahma,  the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” And
previously Kåñëa stated that He is the originator of everything and eve ryone.
Every demigod and every human being is dependent on Him. Men and
demigods, out of ignorance, think that  they are absolute and independent of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That ignorance is removed perfectly by
the discharge of devotional servi ce. This has already been explained in the
previous verse by the Lord. Now, by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the
Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not that
because Kåñëa is Arjuna’s intimate friend Arjuna is flattering Him by calling
Him the Supreme Personality of Godh ead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever
Arjuna says in these two verses is conf irmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions
affirm that only one who takes to devo tional service to the Supreme Lord can
understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse
spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.
In the Kena Upaniñad  it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for
everything, and Kåñëa has already explained that everything is resting  on Him.
The Muëòaka Upaniñad  confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything
is resting, can be realized on ly by those who engage constantly  in thinking of
Him. This constant thinking of Kåñëa is smaraëam,  one of the methods  of
devotional service. It is only by de votional service to Kåñëa that one can
understand his position and get rid of this material body .
In the Vedas  the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One
who understands that Kåñëa is the purest of the pure  can become purified from
all sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he
surrenders  unto the Sup reme Lord. Arjuna’s acceptance of Kåñëa as the
supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is alsoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.confirmed by great personalities, of whom Närada  is the chief.
Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always
meditate upon Him and enjoy one’s tran scendental relationship with Him. He
is the supreme existence. He is free fr om bodily needs, birth and death. Not
only does Arjuna confirm this, but al l the Vedic literatures, the Puräëas  and
histories. In all Vedic literatures Kåñë a is thus described, and the Supreme
Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter , “Although I am unborn, I appear
on this earth to establish religious principles. ” He is the supreme origin; He has
no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from
Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.
Here Arjuna expresses himself through t h e  g r a c e  o f  K å ñ ë a .  I f  w e  w a n t  t o
understand Bhagavad-gétä,  we should accept the statements in these two
verses. This is called the paramparä  system, acceptance of the disciplic
succession. Unless one is in the discipl ic succession, he cannot understand
Bhagavad-gétä.  It is not possible by so-called academic education.
Unfortunately those proud of their ac ademic education, despite so much
evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Kåñëa is
an ordinary person .

O Kåñëa, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me. Neither the

PURPORT
Arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature
cannot understand Kåñëa. He is not kn own even by the demigods, so what to
speak of the so-called scholars of this  modern world? By the grace of the
Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that  the Supreme Truth is Kåñëa and
that He is the perfect one. One should  therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He
received the authority of Bhagavad-gétä.  As described in the Fourth Chapter,
the paramparä  system of disciplic succession for the understanding o f
Bhagavad-gétä  was lost , and therefore Kåñëa reestablished that disciplic
succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and
a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to Gétopaniñad,
Bhagavad-gétä  s h o u l d  b e  u n d e r s t ood in the paramparä  system. When the
paramparä  system was lost, Arjuna was selected to rejuvenate it. The
acceptance by Arjuna of all that Kåñëa says should be emulated; then we can
understand the essence of Bhagavad-gétä,  and then only can we understand
that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
The Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, can be known by persons who are in a
relationship with Him through the discha rge of devotional service, like Arjuna
and his followers. Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know
Kåñëa. Mental speculation that leads one a way from the Supreme Lord is a
serious sin, and one who does not know  Kåñëa should not try to comment on
Bhagavad-gétä.  Bhagavad-gétä  is the statement of Kåñë a, and since it is the
science of Kåñëa, it should be understood from Kåñëa as Arjuna understood i t.
It should not be received from atheistic persons.
As stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.11 ):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvaà yaj jïänam advayam
brahmeti paramätmeti
bhagavän iti çabdyate
The Supreme Truth is realized in th ree aspects: as impersonal Brahman,
localized Paramätmä and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at
the last stage of understanding the Abso lute Truth, one comes to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. A commo n man or even a liberated man who hasCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.realized impersonal Brahman or localized Paramätmä may not understand
God’s personality. Such men, therefor e, may endeavor to understand the
Supreme Person from the verses of Bhagavad-gétä,  which are being spoken by
this person, Kåñëa. Sometimes the impers onalists accept Kåñëa as Bhagavän, or
they accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand
Kåñëa as Puruñottama, the Supreme Person. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him
as Puruñottama. Yet one still may n ot understand that Kåñëa is the father of all
living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Bhüta-bhävana . And if one
comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not
know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is add ressed here as
Bhüteça , the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows Kåñëa as
the supreme controller of all living enti ties, still one may not know that He is
the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Devadeva ,
the wo rshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the
worshipful God of all demigods, one ma y not know that He is the supreme
proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth
about Kåñëa is established in this verse  by the realization of Arjuna, and we
should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Kåñëa as He is.

PURPORT
In this verse it appears that Arjuna is already satisfied with his
understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. By Kåñëa’s
grace, Arjuna has personal experience, intelligence and knowledge and
whatever else a person may have through all thes e agencies, and he has
understood Kåñëa to be the Supreme Pe rsonality of Godhead. For him there is
no doubt, yet he is asking Kåñëa to explain His all-pervading  nature. People in
general and the impersonalists in particular concern themselves mainly with
the all-pervading nature of the Supreme. So Arjuna is asking Kåñëa how He
exists in His all-pervading aspect th rough His different energies. One should
know that this is being asked by Arjuna on behalf of the common people.

O Kåñëa, O supreme mystic, how shall I constantly think of You, and how
shall I know You? In what various forms are You to be remembered, O
Supreme Personality of Godhead?
PURPORT
As it is stated in the previous chap ter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is covered by His yoga-mäyä . Only surrendered souls and devotees can see
Him. Now Arjuna is convinced that His friend, Kåñëa, is the Supreme
Godhead, but he wants to know the gener al process by which the all-pervading
Lord can be understood by the common man. Common men , including the
demons and atheists, cannot know Kåñëa, because He is guarded by His
yoga-mäyä  energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their
benefit. T he superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding
but for the understanding of all mankind.  So Arjuna, out of his mercy, because
he is a Vaiñëava, a devotee, is open ing for the common man the understanding
of the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme Lord. He addresses Kåñëa specifically
as yogin  because Çré Kåñëa is the master of the yoga-mäyä  energy, by which He
is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no
love for Kåñëa cannot always thin k of Kåñëa; therefore he has to think
materially. Arjuna is considering the mo de of thinking of the materialistic
persons of this world. The words keñu keñu ca bhäveñu  refer to material nature
(the word bhäva  means “physical things”). Because materialists cannot
understand Kåñëa spiri tually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on
physical things and try to see how Kåñëa is manifested by physical
representations.

O Janärdana, again please describe in detail the mystic power of Your

PURPORT
A similar statement was made to Süta Gosvämé by the åñis of Naimiñäraëya,
headed by Çaunaka. That statement is:
vayaà tu na vitåpyäma
uttama-çloka-vikrame
yac chåëvatäà rasa-jïänäà
svädu svädu pade pade
“One can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the
transcendental pastimes of Kåñëa, who is glorified by excellent prayers. Those
who have entered into a transcendental re lationship with Kåñëa relish at everyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.step the descriptions of the pas times of the Lord.” ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam  1.1.19 )
Thus Arjuna is interested in hearing about Kåñëa, and specifically how He
remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.
Now as far as amåtam,  nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement
concerning Kåñëa is just like nectar.  And this nectar can be perceived by
practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from
the transcendental pastimes of t he Lord in that one will tire of hearing
mundane stories but one never tires of hearing about Kåñëa . It is for this
reason only that the history of the whol e universe is replete with references to
the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. The Puräëas  are histories of
bygone ages that relate the pastimes of  the various incarnations of the Lord. In
this way the reading matter remains forever fresh , despite repeated readings.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Yes, I will tell you of My
splendorous manifestations, but only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna,
for My opulence is limitless.
PURPORT
It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of Kåñëa and His opulences.
The senses of the individual soul are limited and do not permit him to
understand the totality of Kåñëa’s affair s. Still the devotees try to understand
Kåñëa, but not on the princip le that they will be able to understand Kåñëa fully
at any specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of Kåñëa are
so relishable that they appear to the devotees as nectar . Thus the devotees
enjoy them. In discussing Kåñëa’s opulences a nd His diverse energies, the pure
devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and
discuss  them. Kåñëa knows that living entiti es do not understand the extent of
His opulences; He therefore agrees to  state only the principal manifesta tions of
His different energies. The word prädhänyataù  (“principal”) is very important
because we can understand only a few of  the principal details of the Supreme
Lord, for His features are unlimited . It is not possible to understand them all.
And vibhüti , as used in this verse, refers to the opulences  by which He controls
the whole manifestation. In the Amara-koça  dictionary it is stated that vibhüti
indicates an exceptional opulence.
The impersonalist or pantheist cannot understand the exceptional
opulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energies .
Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are
distributed in every variety of manifestati on. Now Kåñëa is describing what
can be directly perceived by the commo n man; thus part of His variegated
energy is described in this way.

I am the Supersoul, O Arjuna, seated in the hearts of all living entities. I am
the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.
PURPORT
In this verse Arjuna is addressed as  Guòäkeça, which means “one who has
conquered the darkness of sleep.” For th ose who are sleeping in the darkness of
ignorance, it is not possible to unde rstand how the Supreme Personality of
Godhead manifests Himself in various ways in the material and spiritual
worlds. Thus this address by Kåñëa to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is
above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various
opulences.
Kåñëa first informs Arjuna that He is the soul of the entire cosmic
manifestation by dint of His primary ex pansion. Before the material creation,
the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the puruña  incarnations,
and from Him everything begins. T herefore He is ätmä,  the soul of the
mahat-tattva,  the universal elements. The total material energy is not the causeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.of the creation; actually the Mahä-Viñëu enters into the mahat-tattva,  the total
material energy. He is the soul. When Mahä-Viñëu enters i nto the manifested
universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every
entity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists
due to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the
spiritual spa rk, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation
cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul, Kåñëa, enters. As stated in the
Subala Upaniñad,  prakåty-ädi-sarva-bhütäntar-yämé sarva-çeñé ca näräyaëaù:
“The Supreme Personality of Godhead is exi sting as the Supersoul in all
manifested universes.”
The three puruña-avatäras  are described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  They are
also described in the Sätvata-tantra.  Viñëos tu tréëi rüpäëi puruñäkhyäny atho

Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé  Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu—in
this material manifestation. The Mahä-Viñëu, or Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, is
described in the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.47). Yaù käraëärëava-jale bhajati sma

is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of the universal
manifestations, and the end of all energy.

PURPORT
There are twelve Ädityas, of which Kå ñëa is the principal. Among all the
luminaries twinkling in the sky, the sun is the chief, and in the
Brahma-saàhitä  the sun is accepted as the glowing eye of the Supreme Lord.
There are fifty varieties of wind blowing in space, and of these winds the
controlling deity, Maréci, represents Kåñëa.
Among the stars, the moon is the most  prominent at night, and thus the
moon represents Kåñëa. It appears from this verse that the moon is one of the
stars; therefore the stars that twinkle in  the sky also reflect the light of the
sun. The theory that there  are many suns within the universe is not accepted
by Vedic literature. The sun is one, an d as by the reflection of the sun the
moon illuminates, so also do the stars. Since Bhagavad-gétä  indicates herein
that the moon is one of the stars, the twinkling st ars are not suns but are
similar to the moon.

the worlds is a representation of Kåñëa. Therefore the Himälayas, the greatest
mountains in the world, also represen t Him. The mountain named Meru was
mentioned in a prev ious verse, but Meru is sometimes movable, whereas the
Himälayas are never movable. Thus the Himälayas are greater than Meru.

Of all trees I am the banyan tree, an d of the sages among the demigods I am
Närada. Of the Gandharvas I am Citraratha, and among perfected beings I am
the sage Kapila.
PURPORT
The banyan tree ( açvattha ) is one of the highest and most beautiful trees,
and people in India often worship it as one of their daily morning rituals.
Amongst the demigods they also wors hip Närada, who is considered the
greatest devotee in the universe. Th us he is the representation of Kåñëa as a
devotee. The Gandharva planet is filled with entities who sing beautifully, and
among them the best singer is Citrarat ha. Amongst the perfect living entities,
Kapila, the son of Devahüti, is a representative of Kåñ ëa. He is considered an
incarnation of Kåñëa, and His philosophy  is mentioned in the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  Later on another Kapila became famous, but his
philosophy was atheistic. Thus there is a gulf of difference between them.

TRANSLATION
Of horses know Me to be Uccaiùçravä, produced during the churning of the
ocean for nectar. Of lordly elephants I am Airävata, and among men I am the
monarch.
PURPORT
The devotee demigods and the demons ( asuras ) once took part in churning
the sea. From this churning, nectar an d poison were produced, and Lord Çiva
drank the poison. From the nectar were  produced many entities, of which
there was a horse named Uccaiùçravä.  Another animal produced from the
nectar was an elephant named Airävata. Because these two animals were
produced from nectar, they have special significance, and they are
representatives of Kåñëa.
Amongst the human beings, the king is the representative of Kåñëa because
Kåñëa is the maintainer of the universe, and the kings, who are appointed on
account of their godly qualifications, ar e maintainers of their kingdoms. Kings
like Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira , Mahäräja Parékñit and Lord Räma were all highly
righteous kings who always thought of the citizens’ welfare. In Vedic literature,
the king is considered to be the repres entative of God. In this age, however,
with the corruption of the principles of relig ion, monarchy decayed and is now
finally abolished. It is to be underst ood that in the past, however, people were
more happy under righteous kings.

TRANSLATION
Of weapons I am the thunderbolt; among cows I am the surabhi. Of causes
for procreation I am Kandarpa, the god of love, and of serpents I am Väsuki.
PURPORT
The thunderbolt, indeed a mighty weapon, represents Kåñëa’s power. In
Kåñëaloka in the spiritual sky there are cows which can be milked at any time,
and they give as much milk as one likes. Of course such cows do not exist in
this material world, but there  is mention of them in Kåñëaloka. The Lord keeps
many such cows, which are called surabhi.  It is stated that the Lord is engaged
in herding the surabhi  cows. Kandarpa is the sex desire for presenting good
sons; therefore Kandarpa is the representative of K åñëa. Sometimes sex is
engaged in only for sense gratification; such sex does not represent Kåñëa. But
sex for the generation of good childr en is called Kandarpa and represents
Kåñëa.

PURPORT
Among the many-hooded Näga serpents, Ananta is the greatest, as is the
demigod Varuëa among the aquatics. They  both represent Kåñëa. There is also
a planet of Pitäs, ancestors, presided  over by Aryamä, who represents Kåñëa.
There are many living entities w ho give punishment to the miscreants, and
among them Yama is the chief. Yama is situated in a planet near this earthly
planet. After death those who are very  sinful are taken there, and Yama
arranges different kinds of punishments for them.

Diti and Aditi are two sisters. The sons  of Aditi are called Ädityas, and the
sons of Diti are called Daityas. All th e Ädityas are devotees of the Lord, and
all the Daityas are atheistic. Although Pr ahläda was born in the family of the
Daityas, he was a gr eat devotee from his childhood. Because of his devotional
service and godly nature, he is considered to be a representative of Kåñëa.
There are many subduing principles, but time wears down all things in the
material universe and so represents Kåñëa.  Of the many animals, the lion is the
most powerful and ferocious, and of the million varieties of birds, Garuòa, the
bearer of Lord Viñëu, is the greatest.

PURPORT
Among the created manifestations, the first is the creation of the total
material elements. As explained before , the cosmic manifestation is created
and conducted by Mahä-Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé
Viñëu, and then again it is annihilated  by Lord Çiva. Brahmä is a secondary
creator. All these agents of creation, maintenance and annihilation are
incarnations of the material qualitie s of the Supreme Lord. Therefore He is
the beginning, the middle and the end of all creation.
For advanced education there are variou s kinds of books of knowledge, such
as the four Vedas,  their six supplements, the Vedänta-sütra,  books of logic,
books of religiosity and the Puräëas.  So all together there are fourteen
divisions of books of education . Of these, the book which presents
adhyätma-vidyä,  spiritual knowledge—in particular, the
Vedänta-sütra —represents Kåñëa.
Among logicians there are different kinds of argument. Supporting one’s
argument with evidence that also supports the opposing side is called jalpa.
Merely trying to defeat one’s opponent is called vitaëòä . But the actual
conclusion is called väda.  This co nclusive truth is a representation of Kåñëa.

Of letters I am the letter A, and among compound words I am the dual

PURPORT
A-kära,  the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is the beginning of the
Vedic literature. Without a-kära,  nothing can be sounded; therefore it is the
beginning of sound. In Sanskrit there are also many compound words, of which
the dual word, like räma-k åñëa,  is called dvandva.  In this compound, the words
räma  and kåñëa  have the same form, and therefore the compound is called
dual.
Among all kinds of killers, time is the ultimate because time kills
everything. Time is the representative of Kåñëa because in due course of time
there will be a great fire and everything will be annihilated.
Among the living entities who are creators, Brahmä, who has four heads, is
the chief. Therefore he is a representative of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa.

I am all-devouring death, and I am the generating principle of all that is yet

steadfastness and patience.
PURPORT
As soon as a man is born, he dies at  every moment. Thus death is devouring
every living entity at every moment, but the last stroke is called death itself.
That death is Kåñëa. As for future development, all living entities undergo six
basic changes. They are born, they grow, they remain for some time, they
reproduce, they dwindle, and finally they vanish. Of these changes, the first is
deliverance from the womb, and that is  Kåñëa. The first generation is the
beginning of all future activities.
The seven opulences listed—fame, fortune, fine speech, memory,
intelligence, steadfastness and patience—are considered feminine. If a personCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.possesses all of them or some of them he becomes glorious. If a man is famous
as a righteous man, that makes him gl orious. Sanskrit is a perfect language and
is therefore very glorious. If after st udying one can remember a subject matter,
h e  i s  g i f t e d  w i t h  a  g o o d  m e m o r y ,  o r  småti.  And the ability not only to read
many books on different subject matters but to understan d them and apply
them when necessary is intelligence ( medhä ), another opulence. The ability to
overcome unsteadiness is called firmness or steadfastness ( dhåti ). And when
one is fully qualified yet is humble and ge ntle, and when one is able to keep his
balance both in sorrow and in the ecstas y of joy, he has the opulence called
patience ( kñamä ).

TRANSLATION
Of the hymns in the Säma Veda I am th e Båhat-säma, and of poetry I am the
Gäyatré. Of months I am Märgaçérña [November-December], and of seasons I
am flower-bearing spring.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT
It has already been explained by  the Lord that amongst all the Vedas,  He is
the Säma Veda.  The Säma Veda  is rich with beautiful songs played by the
various demigods. One of these songs is the Båhat-säma,  which has an exquisite
melody and is sung at midnigh t.
In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter
are not written whimsically, as in much  modern poetry. Amongst the regulated
poetry, the Gäyatré mantra,  which is chanted by the duly qualified brähmaëas,
is the most prominent. Th e Gäyatré mantra  is mentioned in the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  Because the Gäyatré mantra  is especially meant for God
realization, it represents the Supreme Lord. This mantra  is meant for
spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, h e
can enter into the transcendental positi on of the Lord. One must first acquire
the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness
according to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the Gäyatré mantra.
The Gäyatré mantra  is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered
to be the sound incarnation of Brahma n. Brahmä is its initiator, and it is
passed down from him in disciplic succession.
The month of November-December is considered the best of all months
because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time and the people
become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because it is
neither too hot nor too co ld and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish. In
spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating Kåñëa’s pastimes;
therefore this is considered to be the mo st joyful of all seasons, and it is the
representative of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa.

PURPORT
There are many kinds of cheaters a ll over the universe. Of all cheating
processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents Kåñëa. As the
Supreme, Kåñëa can be more deceitful than any mere man. If Kåñëa chooses to
deceive a person, no one can surpa ss Him in His deceit. His greatness is not
simply one-sided—it is all-sided.
Among the victorious, He is victory. He is the splendor of the splendid.
Among the enterprising and industrious, He is the most enterprising, the most
industrious. Among adventurers He is the most adventurous, and among the
strong He is the strongest. When  Kåñëa was present on earth, no one could
surpass Him in strength. Even in His ch ildhood He lifted Govardhana Hill. No
one can surpass Him in cheating, no on e can surpass Him in splendor, no one
can surpass Him in victory, no one can surpass Him in enterpr ise, and no one
can surpass Him in strength.

Of the descendants of Våñëi I am Väsudeva, and of the Päëòavas I am
Arjuna. Of the sages I am Vyäsa, and among great thinkers I am Uçanä.
PURPORT
Kåñëa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Baladeva is
Kåñëa’s immediate expansion. Both Lord Kåñëa and Baladeva appeared as sons
of Vasudeva, so both of Them may be  called Väsudeva. From another point of
view, because Kåñëa never leaves Vån dävana, all the forms of Kåñëa that
appear elsewhere are His expansions. Väsudeva is Kåñëa’s immediate
expansion, so Väsudeva is not different from Kåñëa. It is to be understood that
the Väsudeva referred to in this verse of Bhagavad-gétä  is Baladeva, or
Balaräma, because He is the original source of all incarnations and thus He is
the sole source of Väsudeva. The immed iate expansions of the Lord are called
sväàça  (personal expansions), and th ere are also expansions called
vibhinnäàça  (separated expansions) .Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Amongst the sons of Päëòu, Arjuna is famous as Dhanaïjaya. He is the best
of men and therefore represents Kåñëa. Among the munis,  or learned men
conversant in Vedic knowledge, Vyäsa is the greatest because he explained
Vedic knowledge in many different way s for the understanding of the common
mass of people in this Age of Kali. And Vyäsa is also known as an incarnation
of Kåñëa; therefore Vyäsa also represents Kåñëa. Kavis  are those who are
capable of thinking thoroughly on any subject matter. Among the kavis,
Uçanä, Çukräcärya, was the spiritual master of the demons; he was an
extremely intelligent and far-seeing politician. Thus Çukräcärya is another
representative of the opulence of Kåñëa.

There are many suppressing agents, of which the most important are those
that cut down miscreants. When misc reants are punished, the agency of
chastisement represents Kåñëa. Among th ose who are trying to be victorious in
some field of activity, the most vi ctorious element is morality. Among the
confidential activities of hearing, thinking and meditating, silence is most
important because by silence one can make progress very quickly. The wise
man is he who can discriminate between matter and spirit, between  God’s
superior and inferior natures. Such knowledge is Kåñëa Himself.

As stated in the Vedic literature, al though the opulences and energies ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the Supreme are understood in various ways, there is no limit to such

Simply a few examples are being descri bed to Arjuna to pacify his

TRANSLATION
But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a
single fragment of Myself I pervad e and support this entire universe.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord is represented throug hout the entire material universes
by His entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna
that there is no point in understand ing how things exist in their separate
opulence and grandeur. He shoul d know that all things are existing due to
Kåñëa’s entering them as Supersoul. Fr om Brahmä, the most gigantic entity, on
down to the smallest ant, all are exis ting because the Lord has entered each
and all and is sustaining them.
There is a Mission that regularly pr opounds that worship of any demigod
will lead one to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the supreme goal. But
worship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.greatest demigods like Brahmä and Çi va represent only part of the opulence of
the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater
than Him. He is asamaurdhva,  which means that no one is superior to Him and
t h a t  n o  o n e  i s  e q u a l  t o  H i m .  I n  t h e  Padma Puräëa  it is said tha t one who
considers the Supreme Lord Kåñëa in the same category with demigods—be
they even Brahmä or Çiva—becomes at  once an atheist. If, however, one
thoroughly studies the different descri ptions of the opulences and expansions
of Kåñëa’s energy, then one  can understand without any doubt the position of
Lord Çré Kåñëa and can fix his mind  in the worship of Kåñëa without
deviation. The Lord is all-pervad ing by the expansion of His partial
representation, the Supersoul, who en ters into everything that is. Pu re
devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in Kåñëa consciousness in full
devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental
position. Devotional service and worship of Kåñëa are very clearly indicated in
this chapter in vers es eight  through eleven . That is the way of pure devotional
service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association
with the Supreme Personality of Godh ead has been thoroughly explained in
this chapter. Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa, a g reat äcärya  in disciplic
succession from Kåñëa, concludes his commentary on this chapter by saying,
yac-chakti-leçät suryädyä
bhavanty aty-ugra-tejasaù
yad-aàçena dhåtaà viçvaà
sa kåñëo daçame ’rcyate
From Lord Kåñëa’s potent energy even  the powerful sun gets its power, and
by Kåñëa’s partial expansion the whol e world is maintained. Therefore Lord
Çré Kåñëa is worshipable .
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the Çrémad

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: By my hearing the instructions You have kindly given me about
these most confidential spiritual subjects , my illusion has now been dispelled.
PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.This chapter reveals Kåñëa as the cause of all causes. He is even the cause of
the Mahä-Viñëu, from whom the material  universes emanate. Kåñëa is not an
incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely
explained in the last chapt er.
Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This
means that Arjuna no longer thinks of  Kåñëa as a mere human being, as a
friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is
glad that he has such a gr eat friend as Kåñëa, but now he is thinking that
although he may accept Kåñëa as the source of everything, others may not. So
in order to establish Kåñëa’s divinity fo r all, he is requesting Kåñëa in this
chapter to show His universal form. Actually when o ne sees the universal form
of Kåñëa one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but Kåñëa is so kind that after
showing it He converts Himself again in to His original form. Arjuna agrees to
what Kåñëa has several times said: Kåñëa is speaking to him just for his benefit.
So Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by Kåñëa’s grace. He
is now convinced that Kåñëa is the cause of all causes and is present in
everyone’s heart as the Supersoul.

O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and

PURPORT
Arjuna addresses Lord Kåñëa as “lotus-eyed” (Kåñëa’s eyes appear just like
the petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for Kåñëa has assured him, in the
previous chapter, ahaà kåtsnasya jagataù prabhavaù pralayas tathä : “I am the
source of the appearance  and disappearance of this entire material
manifestation.” Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail. Arjuna
further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and
disappearances, He is aloof from them. As the Lord has said in th e Ninth
Chapter, He is all-pervading, yet He is not personally present everywhere.
That is the inconceivable opulence of Kåñëa which Arjuna admits that he has
thoroughly understood.

You have entered into this cosmic manifestation. I want to see that form of
Yours.
PURPORT
The Lord said that because He entere d into the material universe by His
personal representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and
is going on. Now as far as Arjuna is conc erned, he is inspired by the statements
of Kåñëa, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that
Kåñëa is an ordinary person, Arjuna desires to see Him actually in His
universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He
is apart from it. Arjuna’s addressing the Lord as puruñott ama is also significant.
Since the Lord is the Supreme Personal ity of Godhead, He is present within
Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can
understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form,
for Arjun a is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of Kåñëa.
But the Lord can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form
to convince others. Arjuna did not have any personal desire for confirmation.
Kåñëa also understands that Arjun a wants to see the universal form to set a
criterion, for in the future there woul d be so many imposters who would pose
themselves as incarnations of God. Th e people, therefore, should be careful;
one who claims to be Kåñëa should  be prepared to show his u niversal form to
confirm his claim to the people.

PURPORT
It is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the
Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, by the material se nses. But if one is engaged in loving
transcendental service to the Lord fr om the beginning, then one can see the
Lord by revelation. Every living  entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is
not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee,
does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations
as a living entity and acknowledges Kåñëa’s inest imable position. Arjuna could
understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the
unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to
understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word
yogeçvara  is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable
power. If He likes, He can reveal Hi mself by His grace, although He isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.unlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of Kåñëa. He
does not give Kåñëa orders. Kåñëa is not obliged to reveal Himself unless one
surrenders fully in Kåñëa consciousne ss and engages in devotional service.
Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental
speculations to see Kåñëa.

Arjuna wanted to see Kåñëa in His universal form, which, although aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.transcendental form, is just manifest ed for the cosmic manifestation and is
therefore subject to the temporary time  of this material nature. As the
material nature is manifested and not ma nifested, similarly this universal form
of Kåñëa is manifested and nonmanifested.  It is not eternally situated in the
spiritual sky like Kåñëa’s other forms. As  far as a devotee is concerned, he is
not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wa nted to see Kåñëa in
this way, Kåñëa reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen
by any ordinary man. Kåñëa must give one the power to see it.

PURPORT
A pure devotee does not like to see Kå ñëa in any form except His form with
two hands; a devotee must see His univer sal form by His grace, not with the
mind but with spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of Kåñëa, Arjuna is told
not to change his mind b ut his vision. The universal form of Kåñëa is not very
important; that will be clear in subseq uent verses. Yet because Arjuna wantedCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.to see it, the Lord gives him the particular  vision required to see that universal
form.
Devotees who are correctly situated in  a transcendental relationship with
Kåñëa are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences.
The playmates of Kåñëa, the friends of  Kåñëa and the parents of Kåñëa never
want Kåñëa to show His opul ences. They are so immersed in pure love that
they do not even know that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In
their loving exchange they forget th at Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is stated that the boys who play with Kåñ ëa are all highly
pious souls and after many, many births th ey are able to play with Kåñëa. Such
boys do not know that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They
take Him as a personal friend. Therefore Çukadeva Gosvämé recites this verse:
itthaà satäà brahma-sukhänubhütyä
däsyaà gatänäà para-daivatena
mäyäçritänäà nara-därakeëa
säkaà vijahruù kåta-puëya-puïjäù
“Here is the Supreme Person, who is considered the impersonal Brahman by
great sages, the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotees, and a product of
material nature by ordinary men. Now these boys, who have performed many,
many pious activities in their past lives, are playing with that Supreme
Personality of Godhead.” ( Çrémad-Bhägavatam  10.12.11 )
The fact is that the devotee is  not concerned with seeing the viçva-rüpa,  the
universal form, but Arjuna wanted to s ee it to substantiate Kåñëa’s statements
so that in the future people could understand that Kåñëa not only theoretically
or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented
Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must  confirm this because Arjuna is the
beginning of the paramparä  system. Those who are actually interested in
understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñë a, and who follow in
the footsteps of Arjuna should unders tand that Kåñëa not only theoretically
presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the
Supreme.
The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal formCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.because He knew that Arjuna did not pa rticularly want to see it, as we have
already explained.

At that time Arjuna could see in th e universal form of the Lord the
unlimited expansions of the universe situ ated in one place although divided into
many, many thousands.
PURPORT
The word tatra  (“there”) is very significant. It indicates that both Arjuna
and Kåñëa were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form.
Others on the battlefield could not s ee this form, because Kåñëa gave the
vision only to Arjuna. Arjuna co uld see in the body of Kåñëa many thousands
of planets. As we learn from Vedic sc riptures, there are many universes and
many planets. Some of them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some
are made of jewels, some are very great, some are not so great , etc. Sitting on
his chariot, Arjuna could see all these.  But no one could understand what was
going on between Arjuna and Kåñëa.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  14

SYNONYMS
tataù —thereafter; saù—he; vismaya-äviñöaù —being overwhelmed with
wonder; håñöa-romä —with his bodily hairs standing on end due to his great
ecstasy; dhanaïjayaù —Arjuna; praëamya —offering obeisances; çirasä —with
the head; devam —to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kåta-aïjaliù —with
folded hands; abhäñata —began to speak.
TRANSLATION
Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna bowed
his head to offer obeisances and with folded hands began to pray to the Supreme
Lord.
PURPORT
Once the divine vision is revealed , the relationship between Kåñëa and
Arjuna changes immediately. Before, Kåñëa and Arjuna had a relationship
based on friendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering
obeisances with great respect, and with f olded hands he is praying to Kåñëa.
He is praising the universal form. Thus  Arjuna’s relationship becomes one of
wonder rather than friendship. Great devo tees see Kåñëa as the reservoir of all
relationships. In the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds o f relationshipsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.mentioned, and all of them are present in Kåñëa. It is said that He is the ocean
of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the
gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.
Here Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that
wonder, although he was by nature ve ry sober, calm and quiet, he became
ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he be gan to offer his obeisances unto the
Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was no t, of course, afraid. He was
affected by the wonders of the Su preme Lord. The immediate context is
wonder; his natural loving friendship  was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus
he reacted in this way.

Arjuna said: My dear Lord Kåñëa, I see assembled in Your body all the
demigods and various other living entities. I see Brahmä sitting on the lotus
flower, as well as Lord Çiva and all the sages and divine serpents.
PURPORT
Arjuna sees everything in the univer se; therefore he sees Brahmä, who is
the first creature in the universe, an d the celestial serpent upon which the
Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu lies in the lower regions of the universe. This snake bed
is called Väsuki. There are  also other snakes known as Väsuki. Arjuna can see
from the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu up to the topmost part of the universe on the
lotus-flower planet where Brahmä, the first creature of the universe, resides.
That means that from the beginning to the end, eve rything could be seen by
Arjuna, who was sitting in one place on his chariot. This was possible by the
grace of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa.

In a previous verse the Lord promised  to show Arjuna things he would be
very interested in seeing. Now Arjuna sees that the leaders of the opposite
party (Bhéñma, Droëa, Karëa and all the sons of Dhåtaräñöra) and their soldiers
and Arjuna’s own soldiers ar e all being annihilated. This is an indication that
after the death of nearly all the person s assembled at Kurukñetra, Arjuna will
emerge victorious. It is also mentioned here that Bhéñma, who is supposed to be
unconquerable, will also be smashed. So also Karëa. Not only will the great
warriors of the other party like Bhéñma be smashed, but some of the great
warriors of Arjuna’s side also.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Time I am, the great destroyer of
the worlds, and I have come here to de stroy all people. With the exception of
you [the Päëòavas], all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain.
PURPORT
Although Arjuna knew that Kåñëa was his friend and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he was puzzled by the various forms exhibited by
Kåñëa. Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating
force. It is written in the Vedas  that th e Supreme Truth destroys everything,
even the brähmaëas.  As stated in the Kaöha Upaniñad  (1.2.25 ),
yasya brahma ca kñatraà ca
ubhe bhavata odanaù
måtyur yasyopasecanaà
ka itthä veda yatra saù
Eventually all the brähmaëas, kñatriyas  and everyone else are devoured like
a meal by the Supreme. This form of the Supreme Lord is the all-devouring
giant, and here Kåñëa presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time.
Except for a few Päëòavas, ever yone who was present on that battlefield would
be devoured by Him. Arjuna was not in  favor of the fight, and he thought it
was better not to fight; then there would be  no frustration. In reply, the Lord isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.saying that even if he did not fight, every one of  them would be destroyed, for
that was His plan. If Arjuna stopped fi ghting, they would die in another way.
Death could not be checked, even if he di d not fight. In fact, they were already
dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquis hed by the
desire of the Supreme Lord. That is the law of nature.

TRANSLATION
Therefore get up. Prepare to fight and win glory. Conquer your enemies and
enjoy a flourishing kingdom. They are already put to death by My arrangement,
and you, O Savyasäcé, can be but an instrument in the fight.
PURPORT
Savya-säcin  refers to one who can shoot arro ws very expertly in the field;
thus Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows toCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.kill his enemies. “Just become an instrument”: nimitta-mätram.  This word is
also very significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Foolis h persons who do not have sufficient
knowledge think that nature is moving  without a plan and all manifestations
are but accidental formations. There are many so-calle d scientists who suggest
that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of
“perhaps” and “maybe.” There is a spec ific plan being carried out in this
material world. What is this plan? This  cosmic manifestation is a chance for
the conditioned souls to go back to Go dhead, back to home. As long as they
have the domineering mentality which make s them try to lord it over material
nature, they are conditioned. But anyone  who can understand the plan of the
Supreme Lord and cultivate Kå ñëa consciousness is most intelligent. The
creation and destruction of the cosmic  manifestation are under the superior
guidance of God. Thus the Battle of Kurukñetra was fought according to the
plan of God. Arjuna was refusing  to fight, but he was told tha t he should fight
in accordance with the desire of the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy.
If one is in full Kåñëa consciousness and his life is devoted to the Lord’s
transcendental service, he is perfect.

PURPORT
Every plan is made by the Supreme Pe rsonality of Godhead, but He is so
kind and merciful to His devotees that  He wants to give the credit to His
devotees who carry out His plan according to His desire. Life should therefore
move in such a way that everyone  acts in Kåñëa consciousness and understands
the Supreme Personality of Godhead thro ugh the medium of a spiritual master.
The plans of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are understood by His
mercy, and the plans of the devotees are as good as His plans. O ne should
follow such plans and be victorious in the struggle for existence.

voice, as follows.
PURPORT
As we have already explained, because of the situation created by the
universal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna became
bewildered in wonder; thus he began to offer his respectful obeisances to Kåñëa
again and again, and with faltering vo ice he began to pray, not as a friend, but
as a devotee in wonder.

Arjuna said: O master of the senses, the world becomes joyful upon hearing

PURPORT
Arjuna, after hearing from Kåñëa about the outcome of the Battle of
Kurukñetra, became enlightened, and as  a great devotee and friend of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead he said that everything done by Kåñëa is
quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that Kåñëa is t he maintainer and the object of
worship for the devotees and the destroye r of the undesirables. His actions are
equally good for all. Arjuna unders tood herein that when the Battle of
Kurukñetra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many
demigods, siddhas,  and the intelligentsia of the higher planets, and they were
observing the fight because Kåñëa was present there. When Arjuna saw the
universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who
were demons and atheists, co uld not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out
of their natural fear of the devastat ing form of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, they fled. Kåñëa’s treatment of the devotees and the atheists isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.praised by Arjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lo rd because he knows
that whatever He does is good for all.

TRANSLATION
O great one, greater even than Brahmä , You are the original creator. Why
then should they not offer their respectful obeisances unto You? O limitless
one, God of gods, refuge of the univer se! You are the invincible source, the
cause of all causes, transcen dental to this material manifestation.
PURPORT
By this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that Kåñëa is worshipable
by everyone. He is all-pervading, and He  is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is
addressing Kåñëa as mahätmä,  which means that He is most magnanimous andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.unlimited. Ananta  indicates th at there is nothing which is not covered by the
influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and deveça  means that He is the
controller of all demigods and is above th em all. He is the shelter of the whole
universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting tha t all the perfect living
entities and powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him,
because no one is greater than Him. Arjuna especially mentions that Kåñëa is
greater than Brahmä because Brahmä is created by Him. Brahmä is born out of
the lotus stem grown from the navel ab domen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who
is Kåñëa’s plenary expansion; therefore Brahmä and Lord Çiva, who is born of
Brahmä, and all other demigods must o ffer their respectful obeisances. It is
stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  that  the Lord is respected by Lord Çiva and
Brahmä and similar other demigods. The word akñaram  is very significant
because this material creation is subjec t to destruction but the Lord is above
this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior
to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material
cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all-great Supreme.

by You!
PURPORT
Everything is resting on the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He
is the ultimate rest. Nidhänam  means that everything, even the Brahman
effulgence, rests on the Supreme Person ality of Godhead, Kåñëa. He is the
knower of everything that is happenin g in this world, and if knowledge has
any end, He is the end of all knowledge; therefore He is the known and the
knowable. He is the object of knowledge because He is all-pervading. Because
He is the cause in the spiritual wo rld, He is transcendental. He i s also the chief
personality in the transcendental world.

Although Kåñëa is manifested before Arjuna in His universal form, Arjuna
remembers his friendly relationship with  Kåñëa and is therefore asking pardon
and requesting Kåñëa to excuse him for the many informal gestures which arise
out of friendship. He is ad mitting that formerly he did not know that Kåñëa
could assume such a universal form, although Kåñëa explained it as his
intimate friend. Arjuna did not know how many times he may have
dishonored Kåñëa by addressing Him “O my friend,” “O Kåñëa,” “O Yädava,”
etc., without acknowledging His opulence. But Kåñëa is so kind and merciful
that in spite of such opulence He played with Arjuna as a friend. Such is the
transcendental loving reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord. The
relationship between the li ving entity and Kåñëa is fixed eternally; it cannot
be forgotten, as we can see from the be havior of Arjuna. Although Arjuna has
seen the opulence in the universal form, he cannot forget his friendly
relationship with Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, of the moving and
the nonmoving. You are its worshipable chief, the supreme spiritual master. No
one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You. How then could there be
anyone greater than You within the three worlds, O Lord of immeasurable
power?
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kå ñëa, is worshipable as a father is
worshipable for his son. He is the spiritual master because He originally gave
the Vedic instructions to Brahmä and presently He is also instructing
Bhagavad-gétä  to Arjuna; therefore  He is the original spiritual master, and any
bona fide spiritual master at the presen t moment must be a descendant in the
line of disciplic succession stemming from Kåñëa. Without being a
representative of Kåñëa, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual m aster of
transcendental subject matter.
The Lord is being paid obeisances in  all respects. He is of immeasurable
greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Kåñëa, because no one is equal to or higher than Kåñëa within any
manifestation, spiritual or material. Every one is below Him. No one can excel
Him. This is stated in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (6.8):
na tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate
na tat-samaç cäbhyadhikaç ca dåçyate
The Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but
for Him there is no difference between His senses, His body, His mind and
Himself. Foolish persons who do not perfectly know Him say that Kåñëa is
different from His soul, mind, hear t and everything else. Kåñëa is absolute;
therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated thatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.although He does not have senses like ours, He can perform all sensory
activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can
be greater than Him, no one can be eq ual to Him, and everyone is lower than
Him.
The knowledge, strength and activities  of the Supreme Personality are all
transcendental. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä  (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evaà yo vetti tattvataù
tyaktvä dehaà punar janma
naiti mäm eti so ’rjuna
Whoever knows Kåñëa’s transcendental body, activities and perfection,
after quitting his body, returns to Hi m and doesn’t come back again to this
miserable world. Therefore one should know that Kåñëa’s activities are
different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of Kåñëa; that
will make one perfect. It is also stated  that there is no one who is master of
Kåñëa; everyone is His servant. The Caitanya-caritämåta  (Ädi 5.142 ) confirms,
ekale éçvara kåñëa, ära saba bhåtya:  only Kåñëa is God, and everyone else is His
servant. Everyone is complying with His order. There is no one who can deny
His order. Everyone is acting accordin g to His direction, being under His
superintendence. As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä,  He is the cause of all
causes.

You are the Supreme Lord, to be worshiped by every living being. Thus I fall

PURPORT
Kåñëa’s devotees relate to Kåñëa in various relationships; one might treat
Kåñëa as a son, or one might treat Kåñë a as a husband, as a friend, or as a
master. Kåñëa and Arjuna are related in friendship. As the father tolerates, or
the husband or a master t olerates, so Kåñëa tolerates.

After seeing this universal form, wh ich I have never seen before, I am
gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore
please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the
Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O a bode of the universe.
PURPORT
Arjuna is always in confidence with Kåñëa because he is a very dear friend,
and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend’s opulence, Arjuna is very joyful
to see that his friend Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can
show such a wonderful u niversal form. But at the same time, after seeing that
universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to Kåñëa
out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear,
although he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore  is asking Kåñëa to show
His Näräyaëa form, because He can assume any form. This universal form is
material and temporary, as the mater ial world is temporary. But in the
Vaikuëöha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as
Näräyaëa. There ar e innumerable planets in the sp iritual sky, and in each of
them Kåñëa is present by His plenary manifestations of different names. Thus
Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaikuëöha planets. Of
course in each Vaikuëöha planet the form of  Näräyaëa is four-handed, but the
four hands hold different arrangements of symbols—the conchshell, mace,
lotus and disc. According to the different  hands these four things are held in,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the Näräyaëas are variously named. A ll of these forms are one with Kåñ ëa;
therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.

PURPORT
In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.39) it is stated, rämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena
tiñöhan:  the Lord is eternally situated in hundreds and thousands of forms, and
the main forms are those like Räma, Nåsiàha, Näräyaëa, etc. There are
innumerable forms. But Arjuna knew  that Kåñëa is the original Personality of
Godhead assuming His temporary universa l form. He is now asking to see theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.form of Näräyaëa, a spiritual form. Th is verse establishes without any doubt
the statement of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  that Kåñëa is the orig inal Personality
of Godhead and all other features originate from Him. He is not different from
His plenary expansions, and He is God in  any of His innumerable forms. In all
of these forms He is fresh like a young ma n. That is the constant feature of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who knows Kåñëa becomes free at once
from all contamination of the material world.

PURPORT
Arjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so Lord
Kåñëa, out of His mercy upon His devo tee Arjuna, showed His universal form,
full of effulgence and opulence. This fo rm was glaring like the sun, and its
many faces were rapidly changing. Kåñëa showed this form just to satisfy the
desire of His friend Arjuna. This form  was manifested by Kåñëa through His
internal potency, which is inconceiva ble by human speculation. No one had
seen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was
shown to Arjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets
in outer space could also see it. They had not seen it before, but because of
Arjuna they were also able to see it. In  other words, all the disciplic devotees of
the Lord could see the universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the
mercy of Kåñëa. Someone has comment ed that this form was shown to
Duryodhana also when Kåñëa went to  Duryodhana to negotiate for peace.
Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the peace of fer, but at that time
Kåñëa manifested some of His universa l forms. But those forms are different
from this one shown to Arjuna. It is clea rly said that no one had ever seen this
form before.

PURPORT
The divine vision in this connectio n should be clearly understood. Who
can have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of
divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It
is stated in the Vedic script ures that those who are devotees of Lord Viñëu are
demigods ( viñëu-bhaktäù småtä deväù ). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not
believe in Viñëu, or who recognize only  the impersonal part of Kåñëa as the
Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not  possible to decry Kåñëa and
at the same time have the divine vi sion. One cannot have the divine vision
without becoming divine. In other word s, those who have divine vision can
also see like Arjuna.
The Bhagavad-gétä  gives the description of the universal form. Although
this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna, now one can have
some idea of the viçva-rüpa  after this incident. Those who are actually divine
can see the universal form of th e Lord. But one cannot be divine without
being a pure devotee of Kåñëa. The devotees, however, who are actually in the
divine nature and who have divine vi sion, are not very much interested in
seeing the universal form of th e Lord. As described in the prev ious verse,
Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord Kåñëa as Viñëu, and heCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.was actually afraid of the universal form.
In this verse there are some significant words, just like
veda-yajïädhyayanaiù,  which refers to studying Vedic literature and the
subject matter of sacrificial regulations. Veda  refers to all kinds of Vedic
literature, such as the four Vedas  (Åg, Yajur, Sä ma and Atharva ) and the
eighteen Puräëas,  the Upaniñads  and the Vedänta-sütra.  One can study these
at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are sütras—Kalpa-sütras  and
Mémäàsä-sütras —for studying the method of sacrifice. Dänaiù  refers to
charity which is  offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in
the transcendental loving service of the Lord—the brähmaëas  and the
Vaiñëavas. Similarly, “pious activities” refers to the agni-hotra  and the
prescribed duties of the different castes. And the voluntary acceptance of
some bodily pains is called tapasya.  So one can perform all these—can accept
bodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas,  etc.—but unless he is a devotee
like Arjuna, it is not possible to s ee that universal form. Those who are
impersonalists are also imagining that they  are seeing the universal form of the
Lord, but from Bhagavad-gétä  we understand that the impersonalists are not
devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.
There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an
ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should
follow the principles of Bhagavad-gétä,  otherwise there is no possibility of
attaining perfect spiritual knowl edge. Although Bhagavad-gétä  is considered
the preliminary study of the science of God,  still it is so perfect that it enables
one to distinguish what is what. The fo llowers of a pseudo incarnation may say
that they have also seen the transcendental incarn ation of God, the universal
form, but that is unacceptable because it  is clearly stated here that unless one
becomes a devotee of Kåñëa one cannot s ee the universal form of God. So one
first of all has to become a pure de votee of Kåñëa; then he can claim t hat he
can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of Kåñëa cannot
accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.

PURPORT
In the beginning of Bhagavad-gétä  Arjuna was worried about killing Bhéñma
and Droëa, his worshipful grandfathe r and master. But Kåñëa said that he
need not be afraid of killing his grandfather. When the sons of Dhåtaräñöra
tried to disrobe Draupadé in the assembly of the Kurus, Bhéñma and Droëa
were silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed. Kåñëa
showed His universal form to Arjuna ju st to show him that these people were
already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown to Arjuna
because devotees are always peaceful and they cannot perform such horrible
actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now
Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and Kåñëa showed him. A devoteeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.is not much interested i n the universal form, for it does not enable one to
reciprocate loving feelings. Either a devotee wants to offer his respectful
worshipful feelings, or he wants to s ee the two-handed Kåñëa form so that he
can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

showed His two-armed form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna.
PURPORT
When Kåñëa appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devaké, He first of allCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.appeared as four-armed Näräyaëa, but when He was requested by His parents,
He transformed Himself into an ordinary child in appearance. Similarly, Kåñëa
knew that Arjuna was not interes ted in seeing a four-handed form, but since
Arjuna asked to see this four-handed form, Kåñëa also showed him this form
again and then showed Himself in  His two-handed form. The word
saumya-vapuù  is very significant. Saumya-vapuù  is a very beautiful form; i t is
known as the most beautiful form. Wh en He was present, everyone was
attracted simply by Kåñëa’s form, and because Kåñëa is the director of the
universe, He just banished the fear of  Arjuna, His devotee, and showed him
again His beautiful form of Kåñëa . In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.38) it is stated,

with the ointment of love can see the beautiful form of Çré Kåñëa.

seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, I am now composed in mind, and
I am restored to my original nature.
PURPORT
Here the words mänuñaà rüpam  clearly indicate the Supreme Personality of
Godhead to be originally two-handed. Those who deride Kåñëa as if He were
an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If
Kåñëa is like an ordinary human bei ng, then how is it possible for Him to show
the universal form and again to show th e four-handed Näräyaëa form? So it is
very clearly stated in Bhagavad-gétä  that one who thinks that Kåñëa is an
ordinary person and who misguides the reader by claiming that  it is the
impersonal Brahman within Kåñëa speaking is doing the greatest injustice.
Kåñëa has actually shown His universal form and His four-handed Viñëu form.
So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure devotee is not confused
by misguiding commenta ries on Bhagavad-gétä  because he knows what is what.
The original verses of Bhagavad-gétä  are as clear as the sun; they do not require
lamplight from foolish commentators.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, this form of
Mine you are now seeing is very difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever
seeking the opportunity to see this form, which is so dear.
PURPORT
In the forty-eighth  verse of this chapter Lord Kåñëa concluded revealing
His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be
seen by so many pious activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word
su-durdarçam  is used, indicating that Kåñëa’s two-handed form is still more
confidential. One may be able to see the universal form of Kåñëa by adding a
little tinge of devotional service to vari ous activities like penances, Vedic study
and philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but wi thout a tinge of bhakti
one cannot see; that has already been ex plained. Still, beyond that universal
form, the form of Kåñëa with two hands is still more difficult to see, even for
demigods like Brahmä and Lord Çiva. They desire to see Him, and we have
evidence in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  that when He was supposed to be in the
womb of His mother, Devaké, all the de migods from heaven came to see the
marvel of Kåñëa, and they offered nice  prayers to the Lord, although He was
not at that time visible to them. Th ey waited to see Him. A foolish person may
deride Him, thinking Him an ordinary person, and may offer respect not to
Him but to the impersonal “somethi ng” within Him, but these are all
nonsensical postures. Kåñëa in His two-armed form is actually desired t o beCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.seen by demigods like Brahmä and Çiva.
In Bhagavad-gétä  (9.11) it is also confirmed, avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà
tanum äçritaù:  He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. Kåñëa’s
body, as confirmed by Brahma-saàhitä  and confirmed by Kåñëa Himself in
Bhagavad-gétä,  is completely s piritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body
is never like a material body. But fo r some who make a study of Kåñëa by
reading Bhagavad-gétä  or similar Vedic scriptures, Kåñëa is a problem. For one
using a material process, Kåñëa is considered to be a great historical personality
and very learned philosopher, but He is an ordinary man, and even though He
was so powerful He had to accept a ma terial body. Ultimately they think that
the Absolute Truth is impersonal; th erefore they think that from His
impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature.
This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is
speculative. Those who are in search of  knowledge also speculate on Kåñëa and
consider Him to be less  important than the universal form of the Supreme.
Thus some think that the universal fo rm of Kåñëa which was manifested to
Arjuna is more important than His pe rsonal form. According to them, the
personal form of the Supreme is  something imaginary. They be lieve that in the
ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is  not a person. But the transcendental
process is described in Bhagavad-gétä,  Chapter Four:  to hear about Kåñëa from
authorities. That is the actual Vedic pr ocess, and those who are actually in the
Vedi c line hear about Kåñëa from authority, and by repeated hearing about
Him, Kåñëa becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, Kåñëa is covered
by His yoga-mäyä  potency. He is not to be s een or revealed to anyone and
everyone. Only by one to whom He re veals Himself can He be seen. This is
confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute
Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous Kåñëa
consciousness and by devotional service to Kåñëa, can have his  spiritual eyes
opened and can see Kåñëa by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even
for the demigods; therefore it is difficu lt even for the demigods to understand
Kåñëa, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing Kåñëa in His
two-ha nded form. The conclusion is that al though to see the universal form of
Kåñëa is very, very difficult and not possi ble for anyone and everyone, it is stillCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.more difficult to understand His personal form as Çyämasundara.

Kåñëa first appeared  before His parents Devaké and Vasudeva in a
four-handed form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed
form. This mystery is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or
who are devoid of devotional service. Fo r scholars who have simply studied
Vedic literature by way of grammatical knowledge or mere academic
qualifications, Kåñëa is not possible to understand. Nor is He to be understood
by persons who officially go to the te mple to offer worship. They make thei rCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.visit, but they cannot understand Kåñë a as He is. Kåñëa can be understood

the next verse.

TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, only by undivided de votional service can I be understood as
I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can
you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.
PURPORT
Kåñëa can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional
service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized
commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-gétä  by the speculative process,
will know that they are simply wasting  their time. No one can understandCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Kåñëa or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once
changed Himself into a two-handed form . These things are very difficult to
understand by study of the Vedas  or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it
is clearly stated here that no one ca n see Him or enter into understanding of
these matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic
literature can learn about Him from th e Vedic literature in so many ways.
There are so many rules and r egulations, and if one at all wants to understand
Kåñëa, he must follow the regulative pr inciples described in the authoritative
literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For
example, to undergo serious penances one may obser ve fasting on Janmäñöamé,
the day on which Kåñëa appeared, an d on the two days of Ekädaçé (the
eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon).
As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the
devote es of Kåñëa who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the
Kåñëa philosophy, or Kåñëa consciousn ess, throughout the world. Kåñëa
consciousness is a benediction to huma nity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by
Rüpa Gosvämé as the most munificent man o f charity because love of Kåñëa,
which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives
some amount of his money to person s involved in distributing Kåñëa
consciousness, that charity, given to  spread Kåñëa consciousness, is the greatest
charity in the world. And if one worships  as prescribed in the temple (in the
temples in India there is always some st atue, usually of Viñëu or Kåñëa), that is
a chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme
Personality of Godh ead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord,
temple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature
(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  6.23):
yasya deve parä bhaktir
yathä deve tathä gurau
tasyaite kathitä hy arthäù
prakäçante mahätmanaù
 [ÇU 6.23(881) ]
One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed byCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the spiritual master, in whom he has similar unflinching faith, can see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead by re velation. One cannot understand Kåñëa
by mental speculation. For one wh o does not take personal training under the
guidance of a bona fide spiritual mast er, it is impossible to even begin to
understand Kåñëa. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no
other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be suc cessful in
understanding Kåñëa.
The personal forms of Kåñëa, the tw o-handed form and the four-handed,
are completely different from the temp orary universal form shown to Arjuna.
The four-handed form of Näräyaëa an d the two-handed form of Kåñëa are
eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is
temporary. The very word sudurdarçam,  meaning “difficult to see,” suggests
that no one had seen that universal fo rm. It also suggests that amongst the
devotees there was no necessity of  showing it. That form was exhibi ted by
Kåñëa at the request of Arjuna so th at in the future, when one represents
himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.
The word na, used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one
should not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in
Vedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of Kåñëa. Only then
can one attempt to write comm entaries on Bhagavad-gétä.
Kåñëa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of
Näräyaëa and then to His own natural fo rm of two hands. This indicates that
the four-handed forms and other forms me ntioned in Vedic literature are all
emanations of the original two-handed K åñëa. He is the origin of all
emanations. Kåñëa is distinct even from  these forms, what to speak of the
impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of Kåñëa are
concerned, it is stated clearly that ev en the most identical four-handed form of
Kåñëa (which is known as Mahä-Viñëu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and
from whose breathing so many innume rable universes are passing out and
entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. As stated in the
Brahma-saàhitä  (5.48),
yasyaika-niçvasita-kälam athävalambya
jévanti loma-vila-jä jagad-aëòa-näthäùCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.viñëur mahän sa iha yasya kalä-viçeño
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
“The Mahä-Viñëu, into whom all the innumerable universes enter and from
whom they come forth again simply by His breathing process, is a plenary
expansion of Kåñëa. Therefore I worship Govinda, Kåñëa, the cause of all
causes.” Therefore one should conclusi vely worship the personal form of Kåñëa
as the Supreme Personality of Godhea d who has eternal bliss and knowledge.
He is the source of all forms of Viñë u ,  H e  i s  t h e  s o u r c e  o f  a l l  f o r m s  o f
incarnation, and He is the original  Supreme Personality, as confirme d in
Bhagavad-gétä.
In the Vedic literature ( Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.1) the following statement
appears:
sac-cid-änanda-rüpäya
kåñëäyäkliñöa-käriëe
namo vedänta-vedyäya
gurave buddhi-säkñiëe
“I offer my respectful obeisances unto Kåñëa, who has a transcendental
form of bliss, eternity and knowledge. I offer my respect to Him, because
understanding Him means understanding the Vedas  and He is therefore the
supreme spiritual master.” Then it is s aid, kåñëo vai paramaà daivatam:  “Kåñëa
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” ( Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.3) Eko vaçé
sarva-gaù kåñëa éòyaù:  “That one Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and He is worshipable.” Eko ’pi san bahudhä yo ’vabhäti:  “Kå ñëa is
one, but He is manifested in unlimited forms and expanded incarnations.”
(Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.21)
The Brahma-saàhitä  (5.1) says,
éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù
sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù
anädir ädir govindaù
sarva-käraëa-käraëam
“The Supreme Personality of Godhead is  Kåñëa, who has a body of eternity,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.knowledge and bliss. He has no be ginning, for He is the beginning of
everything. He is the cause of all causes.”
Elsewhere it is said, yaträvatérëaà kåñëäkhyaà paraà brahma naräkåti:  “The
Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, Hi s name is Kåñëa, and He sometimes
descends on this earth.” Similarly, in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  w e  f i n d  a
description of all kinds of incarnatio ns of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and in this list the name of Kåñëa also appears. But then it is said
that this Kåñëa is not an incarnatio n of God but is the original Supreme
Personality of Godhead Himself ( ete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù kåñëas tu bhagavä n
svayam ).
Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä  the Lord says, mattaù parataraà nänyat : “There
is nothing superior to My form as th e Personality of Godhead Kåñëa.” He also
says elsewhere in Bhagavad-gétä,  aham ädir hi devänäm : “I am the origin of all
the demigods.” And after understanding Bhagavad-gétä  from Kåñëa, Arjuna
also confirms this in the following words: paraà brahma paraà dhäma
pavitram-paramaà bhavän , “I now fully understand that You are the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the re fuge of
everything.” Therefore the universal fo rm which Kåñëa showed to Arjuna is
not the original form of God. The orig inal is the Kåñëa form. The universal
form, with its thousands and thousands of  heads and hands, is manifest just to
draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God’s original
form.
The universal form is not attractive fo r pure devotees, who are in love with
the Lord in different transcendental  relationships. The Supreme Godhead
exchanges transcendental love in His original form of Kåñëa. Therefore to
Arjuna, who was so intimately rel ated with Kåñëa in friendship, this form of
the universal manifestation was not plea sing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna,
who was a constant companion of Kåñëa’s, must have had transcendental eyes;
he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivate d by the universal
form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating
themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional
service the two-handed form of Kåñëa is the most dear.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  55

PURPORT
Anyone who wants to approach the supreme of all the Personalities of
Godhead, on the Kåñëaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately
connected with the Supreme Personality,  Kåñëa, must take this formula, as
stated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore , this verse is considered to be the
essence of Bhagavad-gétä.  The Bhagavad-gétä  is a book directed to the
conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.lording it over nature and who do no t know of the real, spiritual life. The
Bhagavad-gétä  is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence
and his eternal relationship with th e supreme spiritual personality and to
teach one how to go back home, back to  Godhead. Now here is the verse which
clearly explains the pr ocess by which one can attain success in his spiritual
activity: devotional service.
A s  f a r  a s  w o r k  i s  c o n c e r n e d ,  o n e  s h ould transfer his energy entirely to
Kåñëa conscious activities. As stated in the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (2.255 ),
anäsaktasya viñayän
yathärham upayuïjataù
nirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe
yuktaà vairägyam ucyate
No work should be done by any man exce pt in relationship to Kåñëa. This is
called kåñëa-karma.  One may be engaged in various activities, but one should
not be attached to the result of his wo rk; the result should be done only for
Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that
activity into Kåñëa consciousness, one ha s to do business for Kåñëa. If Kåñëa is
the proprietor of the business, then Kåñëa should enjoy the profit of the
business. If a businessman is in possession of thousand s and thousands of
dollars, and if he has to offer all this to  Kåñëa, he can do it. This is work for
Kåñëa. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can
construct a nice temple for Kåñëa, and he can install the Deity of Kåñëa and
arrange for the Deity’s service, as is  outlined in the authorized books of
devotional service. This is all kåñëa-karma.  One should not be attached to the
result of his work, but the result shou ld be offered to Kåñëa, and one should
accept as prasädam  the remnants of offerings to Kå ñëa. If one constructs a very
big building for Kåñëa and installs the Deity of Kåñëa, one is not prohibited
f r o m  l i v i n g  t h e r e ,  b u t  i t  i s  u n d e r s t o o d  that the proprietor of the building is
Kåñëa. That is called Kåñëa consciousne ss. If, however, one is not able to
construct a temple for Kåñëa, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple
of Kåñëa; that is also kåñëa-karma.  One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who
has land—in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of la nd—canCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.utilize that for Kåñëa by growing flowers to offer Him. One can sow tulasé
plants, because tulasé  leaves are very important and Kåñëa has recommended
this in Bhagavad-gétä.  Patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam . Kåñëa desires that one
offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water—and by such an
offering He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulasé.  So one can sow
tulasé  and pour water on the plant. Thus , even the poorest man can engage in
the service of Kåñëa. These are some of  the examples of how one can engage in
working for Kåñëa.
The word mat-paramaù  refers to one who considers the association of Kåñëa
in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does
not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or
heavenly planets, or even the h ighest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He
has no attraction for that. He is only  attracted to being transferred to the
spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into
the glowing brahmajyoti  effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual
planet, namely Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana. He has full knowledge of that
planet, and therefore he is not interest ed in any other. As indicated by the
word mad-bhaktaù,  he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the
nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering,
worshiping, serving the lotus feet of th e Lord, offering prayers, carrying out
the orders of the Lord, making friend s with Him, and surrendering everything
to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or
at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.
The term saìga-varjitaù  is very significant. One should disassociate himself
from persons who are against Kåñëa. Not only are the atheistic persons against
Kåñëa, but so also are those who are attr acted to fruitive activities and mental
speculation. Theref ore the pure form of devotional service is described in
Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.1.11 ) as follows:
anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà
jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam
änukülyena kåñëänu-
çélanaà bhaktir uttamä
 [Madhya 19.167 ]Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.In this verse Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé clea rly states that if anyone wants to
execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of
material contamination. He must be fr eed from the association of persons who
are addicted to fruitive activitie s and mental speculation. When, freed from
such unwanted association and from th e contamination of material desires,
one favorably cultivates knowledge of Kåñëa, that is called pure devotional
service. Änukülyasya saìkalpaù prätikülyasya varjanam  (Hari-bha kti-viläsa
11.676 ). One should think of Kåñëa and act for Kåñëa favorably, not
unfavorably. Kaàsa was an enemy of Kåñëa’s. From the very beginning of
Kåñëa’s birth, Kaàsa planned in so many  ways to kill Him, and because he was
always unsuccessful, he was a lways thinking of Kåñëa. Thus while working,
while eating and while sleeping, he was always Kåñëa conscious in every
respect, but that Kåñëa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite
of his always thinking of Kåñëa twenty-four hours a day, he  was considered a
demon, and Kåñëa at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by Kåñëa
attains salvation immediately, but that is  not the aim of the pure devotee. The
pure devotee does not even want salvatio n. He does not want to be transferred
even to the highest planet, Goloka Våndäv ana. His only objective is to serve
Kåñëa wherever he may be.
A devotee of Kåñëa is friendly to everyo ne. Therefore it is said here that he
has no enemy ( nirvairaù ). How is this? A devotee situated in Kåñëa
consciousness knows that only devotional  service to Kåñëa can relieve a person
from all the problems of life. H e has personal experience of this, and therefore
he wants to introduce this system, Kå ñëa consciousness, into human society.
There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their
lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favor ite example is Lord
Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nond evotees, but he sacrificed his life for
spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand
that he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such a s
Öhäkura Haridäsa and Prahläda Mahäräja. Why such risk? Because they
wanted to spread Kåñëa consciousness, and it is difficult. A Kåñëa conscious
person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his
eternal relationship with Kåñëa . Therefore, the highest benefit one can renderCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.to human society is relieving one’s neighbor from all material problems. In
such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in  the service of the Lord. Now, we can
imagine how merciful Kåñëa is  to those engaged in His service, risking
everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the
supreme planet after leaving the body.
In summary, the universal form of Kåñëa, which is a temporary
manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the
form of Viñëu, four-handed, have all been exhibited by Kåñëa. Thus Kåñëa is
the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that Kåñëa is a manifestation of
the original viçva-rüpa,  or Viñëu. Kåñëa is the origin of all forms. There are
hundreds and thousands of Viñëus, bu t for a devotee no form of Kåñëa is
important but the original form, two-handed Çyämasundara. In the
Brahma-saàhitä  it is stated that those who are attached to the Çyämasundara
form of Kåñëa in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and
cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport
of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of Kåñëa is essential and supreme.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of the Universal Form.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna inquired: Which are considered to be more perfect, those who are
always properly engaged in Your devo tional service or those who worship the
impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested?
PURPORT
Kåñëa has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the
universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yogés.  Generally, the
transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist,
and the other is the personalist. T he personalist devotee engages himself with
all energy in the service of the Suprem e Lord. The impersonalist also engages
himself, not directly in the service of Kåñëa but in meditation on the
impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.
We find in this chapter that of the di fferent processes for realization of the
Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga,  devotional service, is the highest. If one at all
desires to have the association of th e Supreme Personality of Godhead, thenCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.he must take to devoti onal service.
Those who worship the Supreme Lord di rectly by devotional service are
called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the
impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning
which position is better. There are differe nt ways to realize the Absolute
Truth, but Kåñëa indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga,  or devotional
service to Him, is the highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest
means for association with the Godhead.
In the Second Chapter  of Bhagavad-gétä,  the Supreme Lord explained that
a living entity is not the material body; he is a spiritual spark. And the
Absolute Truth is the spiritual whole. In the Seventh Chapter  He spoke of the
living entity as being part and  parcel of the supreme whole and recommended
that he transfer his attention fully  to the whole. Then again in the Eighth
Chapter  it was said that anyone who thinks of Kåñëa at the time of quitting his
body is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to th e abode of Kåñëa. And at
the end of the Sixth Chapter  the Lord clearly said that of all yogés,  one who
always thinks of Kåñëa within himself is considered the most perfect. So in
practically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached
to the personal form of Kåñëa, for that is the highest spiritual realization.
Nevertheless, there are those who are no t attached to the personal form of
Kåñëa. They are so firmly detached  that even in the preparation of
commentaries to Bhagavad-gétä  they want to distract other people from Kåñëa
and transfer all devotion to the imper sonal brahmajyoti.  They prefer to
meditate on the impersonal form of th e Absolute Truth, which is beyond the
reach of the senses and is not manifest.
And so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists. Now Arjuna is
trying to settle the question of which pr ocess is easier and which of the classes
is most perfect. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is
attached to the  personal form of Kåñëa. He is  not attached to the impersonal
Brahman. He wants to know whether hi s position is secure. The impersonal
manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the
Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly
conceive of the impersonal feature of  the Absolute Truth. Therefore ArjunaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.wants to say, “What is the use of such a waste of time?” Arjuna experienced in
the Eleventh Chapter  that to be attached to the personal form of Kåñëa is best
because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there
was no disturbance to his love for Kåñëa. This important question asked of
Kåñëa by Arjuna will clarify the dist inction between the impersonal and
personal conceptions of t he Absolute Truth.

In answer to Arjuna’s question, Kåñëa clearly says that he who concentrates
upon His personal form and who worships  Him with faith and devotion is to be
considered most perfect in yoga.  For one in such Kåñëa consciousness there are
no material activities, because everything is done for Kåñëa. A pure devotee is
constantly engaged. Sometimes he chan ts, sometimes he hears or reads books
about Kåñëa, or sometimes he cooks prasädam  or goes to the marketplace to
purchase something for Kåñëa, or sometimes he washe s the temple or the
dishes—whatever he does, he does not let a single moment pass without
devoting his activities to Kåñëa. Such action is in full samädhi.

TRANSLATION
But those who fully worship the unmanifested, that which lies beyond the
perception of the senses, the all-pervadin g, inconceivable, unchanging, fixed and
immovable—the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth—by controlling
the various senses and being  equally disposed to everyone, such persons,
engaged in the welfare of all, at last achieve Me.
PURPORT
Those who do not directly worship the Supreme Godhead, Kåñëa, but who
attempt to achieve the same goal by an indirect process, also ultimately
achieve the same goal, Çré Kåñëa. “ After many births  the man of wisdom seeks
refuge in Me, knowing that Väsudeva is all.” When a person comes to full
knowledge after many births, he su rrenders unto Lord Kåñëa. If one
approaches the Godhead by the method mentioned in this verse, he has to
control the senses, render service to ever yone and engage in the welfare of all
beings. It is inferred that one has to approach Lord Kåñëa, otherwise there is
no perfect realization. Often there is much penance involved before one fully
surrenders unto Him.
In order to perceive the Supersoul wi thin the individual soul, one has to
cease the sensual activities of seeing, he aring, tasting, working, etc. Then one
comes to understand that the Supreme Soul is present everywhere. Realizing
this, one envies no living  entity—he sees no difference between man and
animal because he sees soul only, not the outer covering. But for the common
man, this method of impersonal realization is very difficult.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  5

TRANSLATION
For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature
of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that
discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.
PURPORT
The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable,
unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called jïäna-yogés,
and persons who are in full Kåñëa consciou sness, engaged in devotional service
to the Lord, are called bhakti-yogés.  Now, here the difference between
jïäna-yoga  and bhakti-yoga  is definitely expressed. The process of jïäna-yoga,
although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome,
whereas the path of bhakti-yoga,  the process of being in dir ect service to theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Supreme Personality of Godhead, is ea sier and is natural for the embodied
soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult
for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore,
the bhakti-yogé  accepts the Deity of Kåñëa as worshipable because there is some
bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course,
worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple
is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may
be saguëa  and nirguëa —of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes.
Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguëa  worship, for the Lord is
represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented
by material qualities such as stone, wood  or oil paint, is not actually material.
That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.
A crude example may be given here. We  may find some mailboxes on the
street, and if we post our letters in thos e boxes, they will naturally go to their
destination without difficulty. But any ol d box, or an imitation which we may
find somewhere but which i s not authorized by the post office, will not do the
work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form,
which is called arcä-vigraha . This arcä-vigraha  is an incarnation of the
Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is
omnipotent, all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation  as arcä-vigraha  He can
accept the services of the devotee, just  to make it convenient for the man in
conditioned life.
So for a devotee there is no diffi culty in approaching the Supreme
immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way
to spiritual realization the path is di fficult. They have to understand the
unmanifested representation of the S upreme through such Vedic literatures as
the Upaniñads,  and they have to learn the language, understand the
nonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes. This is not very easy for
a common man. A person in Kåñëa consciousness, engaged in devotio nal
service, simply by the guidance of th e bona fide spiritual master, simply by
offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of
the Lord, and simply by eating the remnan ts of foodstuffs offered to the Lord,
realizes the Sup reme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubtCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.that the impersonalists are unnecessarily  taking a troublesome path with the
risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the
personalist, without any risk, trouble or difficul ty, approaches the Supreme
Personality directly. A similar passage appears in Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  It is
stated there that if one ultimately has to surrender unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead (this surrendering process is called bhakti ), but instead
takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman
and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome.
Therefore it is advised here that one sh ould not take up this troublesome path
of self-realization, because there  is uncertainty in the ultimate result.
A living entity is eternally an individu al soul, and if he wants to merge into
the spiritual whole, he may accomplish  the realization of the eternal and
knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not
realized. By the grace of  some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned
in the process of jïäna-yoga,  may come to the point of bhakti-yoga,  or
devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a
source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied
soul is always in difficulty with the un manifest, both at the time of practice
and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independent, and
one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is aga inst the
nature of his spiritual blissful self. On e should not take up this process. For
every individual living entity the proce ss of Kåñëa consciousness, which entails
full engagement in devotional service, is  the best way. If one wants to ignore
this de votional service, there is the danger  of turning to atheism. Thus the
process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which
is beyond the approach of the senses, as  already expressed in this verse, should
never be encouraged at any t ime, especially in this age. It is not advised by
Lord Kåñëa.

But those who worship Me, giving up all their activities unto Me and being
devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always
meditating upon Me, having fixed their minds upon Me, O son of Påthä—for
them I am the swift deliverer from  the ocean of birth and death.
PURPORT
It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be
delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotionalCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.service one comes to the realization that  God is great and that the individual
soul is subordinate to Him. H is duty is to render service to the Lord—and if he
does not, then he will render service to mäyä.
As stated before, the Supreme Lord can be appreciated only by devotional
service. Therefore, one should be fully  devoted. One should fix his mind fully
on Kåñëa in order to achieve Him. One sh ould work only for Kåñëa. It does not
matter in what kind of wor k one engages, but that work should be done only
for Kåñëa. That is the standard of de votional service. The devotee does not
desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. His life’s mission is to please Kåñëa, and he can sa crifice everything
for Kåñëa’s satisfaction, just as Arjuna  did in the Battle of Kurukñetra. The
process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at
the same time in chanting Hare Kåñëa,  Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/
Hare R äma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental
chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.
The Supreme Lord herein promises th at without delay He will deliver a
pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who
are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer  the soul to whatever planet
they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways,
but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord
Himself takes him. The devotee does not need to wait to become very
experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual s ky.
In the Varäha Puräëa  this verse appears:
nayämi paramaà sthänam
arcir-ädi-gatià vinä
garuòa-skandham äropya
yatheccham aniväritaù
The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice
añöäìga-yoga  in order to transfer his soul  to the spiritual planets. The
responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here
that He Himself becomes the deliverer . A child is completely cared for by his
parents, and thus his position is secure . Similarly, a devotee does not need toCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the
Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier
Garuòa, and at once delivers the devot ee from material existence. Although a
man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very
expert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks
him up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up
the devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy
process of Kåñëa consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service.
Any intelligent man should always pr efer the process of devotional service to
all other paths. In the Näräyaëéya  this is confirmed as follows:
yä vai sädhana-sampattiù
puruñärtha-catuñöaye
tayä vinä tad äpnoti
naro näräyaëäçrayaù
The purport of this verse is that on e should not engage in the different
processes of fruitive activity or cultiv ate knowledge by the mental speculative
process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the
benefits derived from other y ogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices,
charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.
S i m p l y  b y  c h a n t i n g  t h e  h o l y  n a m e  of Kåñëa—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa,
Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—a
devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily,
but this destination cannot be approached by  any other process of religion.
The conclusion of Bhagavad-gétä  is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter :
sarva-dharmän parityajya
mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja
ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo
mokñayiñyämi mä çucaù
 [Bg. 18.66]
One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute
devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness. That will enable one to reach theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.highest perfection of life. There is no  need for one to consider the sinful
actions of his past life,  because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him.
Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization.
Let everyone take shelter of the suprem e omnipotent Godhead, Kåñëa. That is
the highest perfection of life.

PURPORT
One who is engaged in Lord Kåñëa’s devotional service lives in a direct
relationship with the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position is
transcendental from the very beginning. A devotee does not live on theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.material plane—he lives in Kåñëa. T he holy name of the Lord and the Lord
are nondifferent; therefore when a devo tee chants Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa and His
internal potency are dancing on the to ngue of the devotee. When he offers
Kåñëa food, Kåñëa directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee b ecomes
Kåñëa-ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service
cannot understand how this is so, alth ough this is a process recommended in
the Bhagavad-gétä  and in other Vedic literatures.

My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me
without deviation, then follow the regula tive principles of bhakti-yoga. In this
way develop a desire to attain Me.
PURPORT
In this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga  are indicated. The firstCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for Kåñëa, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, by tran scendental love. And the other is for
one who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by
transcendental love. For this second cl ass there are different prescribed rules
and regulations one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of
attachment to Kåñëa.
Bhakti-yoga  is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in
material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense
gratification. But by the practice of bhakti-yoga  these senses can become
purified, and in the purified state th ey come directly in contact with the
Supreme Lord. In this material existenc e, I may be engaged in some service to
some master, but I don’t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get
some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes serv ice from me and
pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be
elevated to the pure stage of love. Th at stage of love can be achieved by
practice of devotional service, performed with the present senses.
This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone’s heart. And, there,
love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by material
association. Now the heart has to be purified of the material association, and
that dormant, natural  l o v e  f o r  K å ñ ë a  h a s  t o  b e  r e v i v e d .  T h a t  i s  t h e  w h o l e
process.
To practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga  one should, under the
guidance of an expert spiritual mast er, follow certain principles: one should
rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and
chant Hare Kåñëa, then col lect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to
offer to the Deity, take prasädam,  and so on. There are various rules and
regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear
Bhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam  from pure devotees. Thi s practice can
help anyone rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress
into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga,  under the rules
and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring o ne
to the stage of love of God.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  10

If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to work

PURPORT
One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of
bhakti-yoga,  under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this
perfectional stage by working for the Su preme Lord. How to do this work has
already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse  of the Eleventh Chapter. One
should be sympathetic to the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness. There are
many devotees who are engaged in th e propagation of Kåñëa consciousness,
and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice  the regulative
principles of bhakti-yoga,  he can try to help such work. Every endeavor
requires land, capital, organization and labor. Just as in business one requires a
place to stay, some capital to use, some labor and some organization to expand,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.so th e same is required in the service of Kåñëa. The only difference is that in
materialism one works for sense gratific ation. The same work, however, can be
performed for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and that is spiritual activity. If one has
sufficient money, h e can help in building an office or temple for propagating
Kåñëa consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various
fields of activity, and one should be inte rested in such activities. If one cannot
sacrifice the results of his activities, the same person can still sacrifice some
percentage to propagate Kåñëa consciousness. This voluntary service to the
cause of Kåñëa consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for
God, whereupon one becomes perfect.

If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness of Me, then try to

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.It may be that one is unable even to sympathize with the activities of Kåñëa
consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because
of some other impediments. If one attach es himself directly to the activities of
Kåñëa consciousne ss, there may be objections from family members, or so many
other difficulties. For one who has such  a problem, it is advised that he
sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such
procedures are described in the Vedic rules. T here are many descriptions of
sacrifices and special functions of puëya,  or special work in which the result of
one’s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated
to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is no t even
interested in the activities of Kåñë a consciousness gives charity to some
hospital or some other social institutio n, he gives up the hard-earned results of
his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving
up the fruits  of one’s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in
that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand Kåñëa
consciousness. Of course Kåñëa consci ousness is not dependent on any other
experience, because Kåñëa consciousness itself  can purify one’s mind, but if
there are impediments to accepting Kåñë a consciousness, one may try to give
up the results of his actions. In that re spect, social service, community service,
national service, sacrifice for one’s country, etc., may be accept ed so that some
day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord.
In Bhagavad-gétä  (18.46 ) we find it is stated, yataù pravåttir bhütänäm:  if one
decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause,  even if he does not know that the
supreme cause is Kåñëa, he will come gradua lly to understand that Kåñëa is the
supreme cause by the sacrificial method.

If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of

meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one
can attain peace of m ind.
PURPORT
As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional
service: the way of regulative principles  and the way of full attachment in love
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to
follow the principles of K åñëa consciousness it is better to cultivate knowledge,
because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position.
Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation
one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality o f Godhead by a
gradual process. There are processes which make one understand that one
himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable
to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way,
then the re are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the
brähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas  and çüdras,  which we shall find in the last chapter
of Bhagavad-gétä.  But in all cases, one should gi v e  u p  t h e  r e s u l t  o r  f r u i t s  o f
labor; this means to emp loy the result of karma  for some good cause.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.In summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest
goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the
other process is direct. Devotional serv ice in Kåñëa consciousness is the direct
method, and the other method  involves renouncing the fruits of one’s
activities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of
meditation, then to the stage of unders tanding the Supersoul, and then to the
stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may take e ither the
step-by-step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for
everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be
understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna, because
he is already  at the stage of loving devotional  service to the Supreme Lord. It is
for others, who are not at this stage; for them the gradual process of
renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and
Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-gétä  is concerned, it is the
direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct method
and surrender  unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does
not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both
happiness and distress, who is tolerant, always satisfied, self-controlled, and
engaged in devotion al service with determination, his mind and intelligence
fixed on Me—such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me.
PURPORT
Coming again to the point of pure devo tional service, the Lord is describing
the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure
devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone.
Nor does a devotee be come his enemy’s enemy; he thinks, “This person is
acting as my enemy due to my own past misdeeds. So it is better to suffer than
to protest.” In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.14.8 ) it is stated: tat te ’nukampäà
susamékñamäëo bhuïjäna evätma-kåtaà vipäkam.  Wh enever a devotee is in
distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord’s mercy upon
h i m .  H e  t h i n k s ,  “ T h a n k s  t o  m y  p a s t  misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater
than I am suffering now. So it is by  the mercy of the Supreme Lord that I  am
not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just getting a little, by the mercyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. ” Therefore he is always calm, quiet
and patient, despite many distressful co nditions. A devotee is also always kind
to everyone, ev en to his enemy. Nirmama  means that a devotee does not
attach much importance to the pain s and trouble pertaining to the body
because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He does not
identify with the body; therefore he is freed from t he conception of false ego
and is equipoised in happiness and distress.  He is tolerant, and he is satisfied
with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor
much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always j oyful.
He is a completely perfect mystic be cause he is fixed in the instructions
received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled he is
determined. He is not swayed by false arguments, because no one can lead him
from the fixed det ermination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that
Kåñëa is the eternal Lord, so no one ca n disturb him. All these qualifications
enable him to fix his mind and intelli gence entirely on the Supreme Lord.
Such a standard of devotional service is u ndoubtedly very rare, but a devotee
becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of
devotional service. Furthermore, the Lord  says that such a devotee is very dear
to Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in f ull Kåñëa
consciousness.

He for whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not disturbed by

PURPORT
A few of a devotee’s qualifications ar e further being described. No one is
put into difficulty, anxiety, fearfulne ss or dissatisfaction by such a devotee.
Since a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way as to put
others into anxiety. At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into
anxiety, he is not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced
that he is not disturbed by any outw ard disturbance. Actually because a
devotee is always engrossed in Kåñëa consciousne ss and engaged in devotional
service, such material circumstances cannot move him. Generally a
materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his sense
gratification and his body, but when he sees that others have something for
their s ense gratification and he hasn’t, he is sorry and envious. When he is
expecting some retaliation from an enemy,  he is in a state of fear, and when he
cannot successfully execute something he  becomes dejected. A devotee who is
always transcendental to all t hese disturbances is very dear to Kåñëa.

My devotee who is not dependent on the ordinary course of activities, who is

is very dear to Me.
PURPORT
Money may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it.
If automatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not
agitated. Naturally a devotee takes a bath at least twice in a day and rises early
in the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly
and outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the essence
of all activities of life and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A
devotee never takes the part of a par ticular party; therefore he is carefree. He
is never pained, because he is free from all designations; he knows that his
body is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure
devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of
devotional service. For example, constr ucting a big building requires great
energy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him
by advancing his devotional service. He  may construct a temple for the Lord,
and f or that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a bigCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.house for his personal relations.

nor is he very much anxious to get a son or disciple, nor is he distressed by not
getting them. If he loses anything which is very dear to him, he does not
lament. Similarly, if he  does not get what he desires, he is not distressed. He is
transcendental in the face of all kind s of auspicious, inauspicious and sinful
activities. He is prepared to accept all kinds of risks for the satisfaction of the
Supreme Lord. Nothing is an impedi ment in the discharge of his devotionalCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.service. Such a devotee is very dear to Kåñëa.

who doesn’t care for any  residence, who is fixed in knowledge and who is
engaged in devotional service—such a person is very dear to Me.
PURPORT
A devotee is always free from all bad association. Sometimes one is praised
and sometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society. But a
devotee is always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or
happiness. He is very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics
about Kåñëa; therefore he is called silent . Silent does not mean that one should
not speak; silent means that one should  not speak nonsense. One should speak
only of essentials, and the most essential speech for  the devotee is to speak for
the sake of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is happy in all conditions; sometimes
he may get very palatable foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor
does he care for any residential facility. He may sometimes live undern eath a
tree, and he may sometimes live in a very  palatial building; he is attracted to
neither. He is called fixed because he  is fixed in his determination and
knowledge. We may find some repetition in the descriptions of the
qualifications of a devotee, b ut this is just to emphas ize the fact that a devotee
must acquire all these qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot
be a pure devotee. Haräv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guëäù : one who is not a
devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to b e recognized as a
devotee should develop the good qual ifications. Of course he does not
extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but engagement in
Kåñëa consciousness and devotional se rvice automatically helps him develop
them.

Those who follow this imperishable path of devotional service and who

PURPORT
In this chapter, from verse 2 through the end—from mayy äveçya mano ye
mäm  (“fixing the mind on Me”) through ye tu dharmämåtam idam  (“this
religion of eternal engagement”)—t he Supreme Lord has explained the
processes of transcendental service for approachi ng Him. Such processes are
very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person engaged in them. The question
of who is better—one who is engaged in  the path of impersonal Brahman or
one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of
Godhea d—was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that
there is no doubt that devotional servic e to the Personality of Godhead is the
best of all processes of spiritual realizatio n. In other words, in this chapter it is
decided that through  good association one develops attachment for pure
devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from
him begins to hear and chant and ob serve the regulative principles ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and  thus becomes
engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended
in this chapter; therefore there is no do ubt that devotional service is the only
absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute
Truth, as described in this chapter, is  recommended only up to the time one
surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not
have the chance to associate with a pure  devotee, the impersonal conception
may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one
works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to
understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the
association of a pure devotee. Fortunatel y, if one develops directly a desire to
engage in Kåñëa consciousness in pure de votional service, he does not need to
undergo step-by-step improvements in sp iritual realization. Devotional service,
as described in t he middle six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä,  is more congenial.
One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because
by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Devotional Service.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O my dear Kåñëa, I wish to know about prakåti [nature],
puruña [the enjoyer], and the field and the knower of the field, and of
knowledge and the object of knowledge.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: This body, O son of Kunté, is calle d
the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.
PURPORT
Arjuna was inquisitive about prakåti  (nature), puruña  (the enjoyer), kñetra
(the field), kñetra-jïa  (its knower), and knowledge and the object of
knowledge. When he inquired about all these, Kåñëa said that this body is
called the field and that one who kn ows this body is called the knower of the
field. This body is the field of ac tivity for the conditioned soul. The
conditioned soul is entrapped in material  existence, and he attempts to lord it
over material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dom inate material
nature, he gets a field of activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is
the body? The body is made of senses . The conditioned soul wants to enjoy
sense gratification, and, according to hi s capacity to enjoy sense gratification,
he is offered a body, or field of activity. Therefore the body is called kñetra,  or
the field of activity for the conditione d soul. Now, the person, who should not
identify himself with the body, is called kñetra-jïa,  the knower of the field. It is
not ver y difficult to understand the difference between the field and its
knower, the body and the knower of th e body. Any person can consider that
from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is
still one person, remaining. Thus there i s a difference between the knower of
the field of activities and the actual fi eld of activities. A living conditioned
soul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in
the beginning— dehino ’smin —that the living entity is withi n the body and
that the body is changing from chil dhood to boyhood and from boyhood to
youth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows
that the body is changing. The owner is distinctly kñetra-jïa.  Sometimes we
think, “I am happy,” “I am a man,” “I am a woman,” “I am a dog,” “I am a cat.”
These are the bodily designations of the knower. But the knower is different
from the body. Although we may use many articles—our clothes, etc.—we
know that we are different from the things used. Si milarly, we also understand
by a little contemplation that we are different from the body. I or you orCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.anyone else who owns the body is called kñetra-jïa,  the knower of the field of
activities, and the body is called kñetra,  the field of activities itself.
In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä  the knower of the body (the living
entity) and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are
described. In the middle six chapters of the Bhagavad-gétä  the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and the rel ationship between the individual soul and
the Supersoul in regard to devotional  service are described. The superior
position of the Supreme Personality of  Godhead and the subordinate position
of the individual soul are definitely defined in these chapters.  The living
entities are subordinate under all circum stances, but in their forgetfulness they
are suffering. When enlightened by pi ous activities, they approach the
Supreme Lord in different capacities —as the distressed, those in want of
money, the inquisi tive, and those in search of knowledge. That is also
described. Now, starting with the Th irteenth Chapter, how the living entity
comes into contact with material nature and how he is delivered by the
Supreme Lord through the different methods of fruitive a ctivities, cultivation
of knowledge, and the discharge of de votional service are explained. Although
the living entity is completely differe nt from the material body, he somehow
becomes related. This also is explained.

TRANSLATION
O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all
bodies, and to understand this body and its knower is called knowledge. That is
My opinion.
PURPORT
While discussing the subject of the bo dy and the knower of the body, the
soul and the Supersoul, we shall find th ree different topics of study: the Lord,
the living entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there
are two souls: the i ndividual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is
the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, Kåñëa
says, “I am also the knower, but I am no t the individual knower of the body. I
am the superknower. I am present in every bo dy as the Paramätmä, or
Supersoul.”
One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower
of the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-gétä,  can attain to
knowledge.
The Lord says, “I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual
body.” The individual may be the know er of his own body, but he is not in
knowledge of other bodies. The Supr eme Personality of Godhead, who is
present as the Supersoul in all b odies, knows everything about all bodies. He
knows all the different bodies of all th e various species of life. A citizen may
know everything about his patch of la nd, but the king knows not only his
palace but all the properties possessed by the individual  citizens. Similarly, one
may be the proprietor of the body indi vidually, but the Supreme Lord is the
proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and
the citizen is the secondary propriet or. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.supreme proprietor of all bodies.
The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is Håñékeça, Which
means “the controller of the senses.” He is the original controller of the senses,
just as the king is the original controlle r of all the activities of the state; the
citizens are seconda ry controllers. The Lord says, “I am also the knower.” This
means that He is the superknower; th e individual soul knows only his
particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:
kñeträëi hi çaréräëi
béjaà cäpi çubhäçubhe
täni vetti sa yogätmä
tataù kñetra-jïa ucyate
This body is called the kñetra,  and within it dwells the owner of the body
and the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body.
Therefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the
field of activities, the knower  of activities, and the supreme knower of
activities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the
body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the
Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as jïäna.  That is the opinion of
Kåñëa. To understand both the soul an d the Supersoul as one yet distinct is
knowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower
of activity is not in perfect knowledge.  One has to understand the position of
prakåti  (nature), puruña  (the enjoyer of nature) and éçvara  ( t h e  k n o w e r  w h o
dominates or controls nature and the in dividual soul). One should not confuse
the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the
painting and the easel.  This material world, which is the field of activities, is
nature, and the enjoyer of nature is th e living entity, and above them both is
the supreme controller, the Personality of  Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic
language (in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  1.12), bhoktä bhogyaà preritäraà ca
matvä/ sarvaà proktaà tri vidham-brahmam etat.  There are three Brahman
conceptions: prakåti  is Brahman as the field of activities, and the jéva
(individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, a nd
the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.In this chapter it will also be explain ed that out of the two knowers, one is
fallible and the other is infallible. One is  superior and the other is subordinate.
One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same
contradicts the Suprem e Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly,
“I am also the knower of the field of activity.” One who misunderstands a rope
to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and
there are different owners of the bodies. B ecause each individual soul has his
individual capacity for lording it ov er material nature, there are different
bodies. But the Supreme also is presen t in them as the controller. The word ca
is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. Tha t is the opinion of
Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa. Kåñëa is th e Supersoul present in each and every
body apart from the individual soul. An d Kåñëa explicitly says here that the
Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoye r.

TRANSLATIONCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is
constituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of
the field of activities is, and what his influences are.
PURPORT
The Lord is describing the field of ac tivities and the knower of the field of
activities in their constitutional positions. One has to know how this body is
constituted, the materials of which this  body is made, under whose control this
body is working, ho w the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are
coming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of
the individual soul is, and what the actu al form of the individual soul is. One
should also know the distinction between the individual living soul and the
Supersoul, their different influences, their potentials, etc. One just has to
understand this Bhagavad-gétä  directly from the description given by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all this will be clarified. But on e should
be careful not to consider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body
to be one with the individual soul, the jéva. This is something like equating the
potent and the impotent.

TRANSLATION
That knowledge of the field of activitie s and of the knower of activities is
described by various sages in various Vedic writings. It is especially presented in
Vedänta-sütra with all reasoning as to cause and effect.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the highest authority in
explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and
standard authorities always give eviden ce from previous authorities. Kåñëa is
explaining this most controve rsial point regarding the duality and nonduality
of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the Vedänta,  which is
accepted as authority. First He says, “T his is according to different sages.” As
far as the sages are concerned, besides Himse lf, Vyäsadeva (the author of the
Vedänta-sütra ) is a great sage, and in the Vedänta-sütra  duality is perfectly
explained. And Vyäsadeva’s father, Paräçara , is also a great sage, and he writes
in his books of religiosity, aham tvaà ca tathänye.  .. “we—you, I and the various
other living entities—are all transcende ntal, although in material bodies. Now
we are fallen into the ways of the thr ee modes of material nature according to
our different karma.  As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the
lower nature. The higher and lower natu res exist due to ignorance and are
being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul,
which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is
transcendental.” Similarly, in the original Vedas,  a distinction between the
soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Kaöha Upaniñad.
There are many great sages who have explained this, and Paräçara is
considered principal among them.
The word chandobhiù  refers to the various Vedic literatures. The Taittiréya
Upaniñad,  for example, which is a branch of the Yajur Veda,  describes nature,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
As stated before, kñetra  is the field of activities, and there are two kinds of
kñetra-jïa:  the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated
in the Taittiréya Upaniñad  (2.9), brahma pucchaà pratiñöhä.  There is a
manifestation of the Su preme Lord’s energy known as anna-maya,  dependence
upon food for existence. This is a ma terialistic realization of the Supreme.
Then, in präëa-maya,  after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one
can realize the Absolute Truth in the living sympto ms or life forms. In
jïäna-maya,  realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of
thinking, feeling and willing. Then th ere is Brahman realization, called
vijïäna-maya,  in which the living entity’s mind and life symptoms are
distinguished fro m the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is
änanda-maya,  realization of the all-blissful na ture. Thus there are five stages of
Brahman realization, which are called brahma puccham.  Out of these, the first
three— anna-maya, präëa-maya  and jïäna-maya —involve the fields of
activities of the living entities. Transcende ntal to all these fields of activities is
the Supreme Lord, who is called änanda-maya.  The Vedänta-sütra  also
describes the Supreme by saying, änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät:  the Supreme
Perso nality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental
bliss, He expands into vijïäna-maya, präëa-maya, jïäna-maya  and anna-maya.
In the field of activities the living enti ty is considered to be the enjoyer, and
different from him is the änanda-maya.  That means that if the living entity
decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the änanda-maya,  then he
becomes perfect. This is the real pict ure of the Supreme Lord as the supreme
knower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate kn ower, and the
nature of the field of activities. One has to search for this truth in the
Vedänta-sütra,  or Brahma-sütra.
It is mentioned here that the codes of the Brahma-sütra  are very nicely
arranged according to cause and effect. Some of the sütras,  or aphorisms, are
na viyad açruteù  (2.3.2 ), nätmä çruteù  (2.3.18 ), and parät tu tac-chruteù
(2.3.40 ). The first aphorism ind icates the field of activities, the second
indicates the living entity, and the third indicates the Supreme Lord, the
summum bonum  among all the manifestations of various entities.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXTS  6–7

TRANSLATION
The five great elements, false ego, in telligence, the unmanifested, the ten
senses and the mind, the five sense obje cts, desire, hatred, happiness, distress,
the aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions—all these are considered, inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.summary, to be the field of activities and its interactions.
PURPORT
From all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns
and the aphorisms of the Vedänta-sütra,  the components of this world can be
understood as follows. First there are ea rth, water, fire, air and ether. These are
the five great element s (mahä-bhüta ). Then there are false ego, intelligence
and the unmanifested stage of the thr ee modes of nature. Then there are five
senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Then
five working senses: voice, legs, hands, anus an d genitals. Then, above the
senses, there is the mind, which is wi thin and which can be called the sense
within. Therefore, including the mind, there are eleven senses altogether.
Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell, taste, form, touch and
sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the field of
activity. If one makes an analytical stud y of these twenty-four subjects, then he
can very well understand the field of activity. Then there are desire, hatred,
happiness and di stress, which are interactions, representations of the five great
elements in the gross body. The living symptoms, represented by consciousness
and conviction, are the manifestation of the subtle body—mind, ego and
intelligence. These subtle elements are i ncluded within the field of activities.
The five great elements are a gross repr esentation of the false ego, which in
turn represents the primal stage of fals e ego technically called the materialistic
conception, or tämasa-buddhi,  intelligence in ignorance. This, further,
represents the unmanife sted stage of the three modes of material nature. The
unmanifested modes of material nature are called pradhäna.
One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with
their interactions should study th e philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-gétä,
a summary only is given.
The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of
the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it
produces by-products, then it begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes.
Therefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing. However, the kñetra-jïa,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the knower of the field, its proprietor, is different.

PURPORT
This process of knowledge is someti mes misunderstood by less intelligent
men as being the interaction of the field of  activity. But actually this is the real
process of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of
approaching the Absolut e Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the
twenty-four elements, as described before. This is actually the means to get out
of the entanglement of those elements. The embodied soul is entrapped by the
body, which is a casing made of the twenty-four  elements, and the process of
knowledge as described here is the means to get out of it. Of all the
descriptions of the process of knowledge,  the most important point is described
in the first line of the eleventh verse. Mayi cänanya-yogena bhaktir
avyabhi cäriëé:  the process of knowledge term inates in unalloyed devotional
service to the Lord. So if one does not a pproach, or is not able to approach, the
transcendental service of the Lord, th en the other nineteen items are of no
particular value. But if one t akes to devotional service in full Kåñëa
consciousness, the other nineteen item s automatically develop within him. As
stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (5.18.12 ), yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä
sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù.  All the good qualities of knowledge develop
in one who has attained the stage of devotional service. The principle ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.accepting a spiritual master, as mentione d in the eighth verse, is essential.
Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important.
Transcendental lif e begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kå ñëa, clearly states here that this
process of knowledge is the actual path . Anything speculated beyond this is
nonsense.
As for the knowledge outlined here, th e items may be analyzed as follows.
Humility means that one should not be  anxious to have the satisfaction of
being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager
to receive honor from others, b ut from the point of view of a man in perfect
knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or
dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after
this material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion,
and consequently sometimes it is fo und that without understanding the
principles of religion one enters in to some group which is not actually
following religious principles and then wa nts to advertise himself as a religious
mentor. As for a ctual advancement in spiritual sc ience, one should have a test
to see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.
Nonviolence is generally taken to mean  not killing or destroying the body,
but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in
general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they
perpetually suffer material pain s. So unless one elevates people to spiritual
knowledge, one is practicing violence. On e should try his best to distribute real
knowledge to the people, so that they  may become enlightened and leave this
material entanglement. That is nonviolence.
Tolerance means that one should be pr acticed to bear insult and dishonor
from others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge,
there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected
because material nature is so c onstituted. Even a boy like Prahläda, who, only
five years old, was engaged in the cu ltivation of spiritual knowledge, was
endangered when his father became an tagonistic to his devotion. The father
tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahläda tolerated him. So there may be
many impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but weCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.
Simplicity means that without diplomac y one should be so straightforward
that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the
spiritual master, that is essential, be cause without the instruction of a bona
fide spiritual master one  cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should
approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so
that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a
bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kåñëa, if he bestows any
blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced
without the disciple’s following the re gulative principles. Or, the regulative
principles will be easier for one wh o has served the spiritual master w ithout
reservation.
Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are
two kinds of cleanliness: external an d internal. External cleanliness means
taking a bath, but for internal cleanline ss one has to think of Kåñëa always and
chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare  Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare
Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of
past karma  from the mind.
Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in
spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.
And self-control means that one sh ould not accept anything which is
detrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed
to this and reject anything which is ag ainst the path of spiritual progress. This
is real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to
have sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not
necessary. The senses should only be grat ified to keep the body fit so that one
can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and
uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then the re is
every possibility of controlling the othe r senses. The function of the tongue is
to taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should
always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa and
chanting Har e Kåñëa. As far as the eyes ar e concerned, they should not be
allowed to see anything but the beautifu l form of Kåñëa. That will control theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kåñëa and the
nose in smelling the flowers offered to Kåñëa. This is the process of devotional
service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gétä  is simply expounding the
science of devotional service. Devo tional service is the main and sole
objective. Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä  try to  divert the
mind of the reader to other subjec ts, but there is no other subject in
Bhagavad-gétä  than devotional service.
False ego means accepting this body as  oneself. When one understands that
he is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False
ego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature ( Båhad-äraëyaka
Upaniñad  1.4.10 ) it i s said, ahaà brahmäsmi:  I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I
am,” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This
sense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body
it is false ego. When the sen se of self is applied to reality, that is real ego.
There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot
give up our ego, because ego means iden tity. We ought, of course, to give up
the false identification with the body.
One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age
and disease. There are descriptions in va rious Vedic literatures of birth. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of
the mother, its suffer ing, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be
thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much
distress we have suffered within the womb  of the mother, we do not make any
solution to the repetition of birth and deat h. Similarly at the time of death
there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the
authoritative scriptures. These should be  discussed. And as far as disease and
old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants t o be
diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these.
Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the
distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our
making advancement in spiri tual life.
As for detachment from children, wife  and home, it is not meant that one
should have no feeling for these. They  are natural objects of affection. ButCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.when they are not favorable to spirit ual progress, then one should not be
attached to them. The best proce ss for making the home pleasant is Kåñëa
consciousness. If one is in full Kåñëa consciousness, he can make his home very
happy, because this process of Kåñëa cons ciousness is very easy. One need only
chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Ha re Räma, Hare
Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to
Kåñëa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gétä  and
Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four things
will make one happy. One should tra in the members of his family in this way.
The family members can sit down mo rning and evening and chant together
Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma,
Räma Räma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to deve lop
Kåñëa consciousness, following these four  principles, then there is no need to
change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not
favorable for spiritual advancement, th en family life should be abandoned.
One must sacrifice ever ything to realize or serve Kåñëa, just as Arjuna did.
Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that
these family members were impediments to his Kåñëa realization, he accepted
the instruction of Kåñëa and fought and killed the m. In all cases, one should be
detached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world
one can never be fully happy or fully miserable.
Happiness and distress are concomitant fa ctors of material life. One should
learn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gétä.  One can never restrict the
coming and going of happiness and distre ss, so one should be detached from
the materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases.
Generally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we
get something undesirable we are distressed. But if we are actually in the
spiritual position these things will not agitate us. To reac h that stage, we have
to practice unbreakable devotional se rvice. Devotional service to Kåñëa
without deviation means engaging onesel f in the nine processes of devotional
service—chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc.—as described in
the last verse  of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed.
Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not wantCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.to mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test
himself by seeing how far he is inclined  to live in a solitary place, without
unwanted association. N aturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary
sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he
understands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research
scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subj ect, but
according to Bhagavad-gétä  such research work and philosophical speculation
have no value. That is more or  less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-gétä,
one should make research, by philosophi cal discretion, into the nature of the
soul. One should  make research to understand the self. That is recommended
here.
As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that
bhakti-yoga  is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,
one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual
soul. The individual soul a nd the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the
bhakti  conception, the devotional concepti on of life. This service of the
individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam,  as it is clearly stated. So
bhakti,  or devotional service, is eternal. One  should be established in that
philosophical conviction.
In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.11 ) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvaà yaj jïänam advayam.  “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute
Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman,
Paramätmä and Bhagavän.” B hagavän is the last word in the realization of the
Absolute Truth; therefore one shou ld reach up to that platform of
understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the
devotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge .
Beginning from practicing humility up  to the point of realization of the
Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of  Godhead, this process is just like a
staircase beginning from the ground fl oor and going up to the top floor. Now
on this staircase there ar e so many people who have reached the first floor, the
second or the third floor, etc., but un less one reaches the top floor, which is
the understanding of Kåñëa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone
wants to compete with God and at the same time  make advancement inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrat ed. It is clearly stated that without
humility, understanding is not truly po ssible. To think oneself God is most
puffed up. Although the living entity is  always being kicked by the stringent
laws of material nature, he still thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. The
beginning of knowledge, therefore, is amänitva,  humility. One should be
humble and know that he is subordinat e to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion
against the Supreme Lord, one b ecomes subordinate to material nature. One
must know and be convinced of this truth.

TRANSLATION
I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal.
Brahman, the spirit, beginningless and subordinate to Me, lies beyond the cause
and effect of this material world.
PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field.
He has also explained the process of  knowing the knower of the field of
activities. Now He begins to explain th e knowable, first the soul and then the
Supersoul. By knowledge of th e knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one
can relish the nectar of life. As expl ained in the Second Chapter, the living
entity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which
the jéva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of the jévätmä’s
manifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The
Vedic literature confirms this: na jäyate mriyate vä vipaçcit  (Kaöha Upaniñad
1.2.18 ). The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of
knowledge.
The Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is also stated in the Vedic literature
(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  6.16) to be pradhäna-kñetrajïa-patir guëeçaù,  the chief
knower of the body and the master of the three modes of material nature. In
the småti  it is said, däsa-b hüto harer eva nänyasvaiva kadäcana.  The living
entities are eternally in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is also
confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teachings. Therefore the description of
Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individu al soul, and
when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood
that he is vijïäna-brahma  as opposed to änanda-brahma.  Änanda-brahma  is the
Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes, heads and faces, and He has
ears everywhere. In this way the Su persoul exists, pervading everything.
PURPORT
As the sun exists diffusing its unlimi ted rays, so does the Supersoul, or
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He exists in His all-pervading form, and in
Him exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great
teacher, Brahmä, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs,
hands and eyes, and unlimited living enti ties. All are existing in and on the
Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul,
however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes ev erywhere. That is
not possible. If he thinks that under ignorance he is not conscious that his
hands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge
he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the
indiv idual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme.
The Supreme is different from the in dividual soul. The Supreme Lord can
extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-gétä
the Lord says that if anyone offer s Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He
accepts it. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is
the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode,
far, far away from earth, He can extend His hand t o accept what anyone
offers. That is His potency. In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.37) it is stated, goloka eva
nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù:  although He is always engaged in pastimes in HisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.transcendental planet, He is all-perv ading. The individual soul cannot claim
that he is all-pervading. Therefore th is verse describes the Supreme Soul, the
Personality of Godhead, not the individual soul.

TRANSLATION
The Supersoul is the original source of  all senses, yet He is without senses.
He is unattached, although He is th e maintainer of all living beings. He
transcends the modes of nature, and at th e same time He is the master of all the
modes of material nature .
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord, although the source  of all the senses of the living
entities, doesn’t have material senses like they have. Actually, the individual
souls have spiritual senses, but in cond itioned life they are covered with theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.material elements, and ther efore the sense activities are exhibited through
matter. The Supreme Lord’s senses are not so covered. His senses are
transcendental and are therefore called nirguëa.  Guëa  means the material
modes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be  understood
that His senses are not exactly like ours . Although He is the source of all our
sensory activities, He has His transcendental senses, which are
uncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad
(3.19) in the verse apäëi -pädo javano grahétä.  The Supreme Personality of
Godhead has no hands which are mater ially contaminated, but He has His
hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction
between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has n o material eyes, but
He has eyes—otherwise how could He see? He sees everything—past, present
and future. He lives within the heart of  the living being, and He knows what
we have done in the past, what we ar e doing now, and what is awaiting us in
the futur e. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä : He knows everything, but
no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He
can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the
Lord is not impersonal; He ha s His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and
because we are part and parcel of the Su preme Lord we also have these things.
But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.
Bhagavad-gétä  also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is
by His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy,
because He is the Lord of material ener gy. In the Vedic literature we find that
His whole embodiment is spiri tual. He has His eternal form, called
sac-cid-änanda-vigraha  [Bs. 5.1]. He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor
of all wealth and the owner of all energy . He is the most intelligent and is full
of knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the S upreme Personality of
Godhead. He is the maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all
activity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord
is always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands or legs,
He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation we can
see the Lord’s form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His
form. Therefore the impersonalists, who are still materially affected, cannotCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.understand the Personal ity of Godhead.

PURPORT
In Vedic literature we understand that Näräyaëa, the Supreme Person, is

the spiritual and material worlds. Although  He is far, far away, still He is near
to us. These are the st atements of Vedic literature. Äséno düraà vrajati çayäno

transcendental bliss, we cannot understand how He is enjoying His full
opulence. We cannot see or understand with these mate rial senses. ThereforeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.in the Vedic language it is said that to understand Him our material mind and
senses cannot act. But one who has purified his mind and senses by practicing
Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service can see Him constantly. It is
confi rmed in Brahma-saàhitä  that the devotee who has developed love for the

PURPORT
The Lord is situated in everyone’s he art as the Supersoul. Does this meanCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.that He has become divided? No. Actua lly, He is one. The example is given of
the sun: The sun, at the meridian, is situ ated in its place. But if one goes for
five thousand miles in a ll directions and asks, “Where is the sun?” everyone
will say that it is shining on his head. In the Vedic literature this example is
given to show that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided. Also
it is said in Vedic literature that one Vi ñëu is present everywhere by His
omnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons. And the
Supreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours
everything at the time of annihilation. This was confirmed in the Eleventh

devours also. He is the annihilator, the ki ller of all. When there is creation, He
develops all from their original  state, and at the time of annihilation He
devours them. The Vedic hymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all
living entities and the rest of all. After creation, everything rests in His
omnipotence, and after annihilation everything again returns  to rest in Him.

He is the source of light in all luminous objects. He is beyond the darkness
of matter and is unmanifested. He is know ledge, He is the object of knowledge,
and He is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone’s heart.
PURPORT
The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light
in all luminous objects like the sun, moon and stars. In the Vedic literature we
find that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon, because the
effulgence of the Sup reme Lord is there. In the material world that
brahmajyoti,  the Lord’s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva,  the
material elements; therefore in this mate rial world we require the assistance of
sun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But i n the spiritual world there is no need
of such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His
luminous effulgence, everything is illumi nated. It is clear, therefore, that His
situation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world,
which is far, far away in the spiritual sk y. That is also confirmed in the Vedic
literature. Äditya-varëaà tamasaù parastät  (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  3.8). He is
just like the sun, eternally luminous , but He is far, far beyond the dark ness of
this material world.
His knowledge is transcendental. Th e Vedic literature confirms that
Brahman is concentrated transcendental  knowledge. To one who is anxious to
be transferred to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord,
who is situated in everyone’s hea rt. One Vedic mantra  (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad
6.18) says, taà ha devam ätma-buddhi-prakäçaà mumukñur vai çaraëam ahaà
prapadye.  One must surrender unto the Supr eme Personality of Godhead if he
at all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge  is concerned, it
is also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditväti måtyum eti.  “Only byCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.knowing Him can one surpass the bo undary of birth and death.” ( Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad  3.8)
He is situated in everyone’s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme
has legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the
individual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of
activity—the individual soul and the S upersoul—must be admitted. One’s
hands and legs are distributed locally, but Kåñëa’s hands and legs are
distributed everywhere. This is confirmed in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (3.17):
sarvasya prabhum éçänaà sarvasya çaraëaà båhat.  That Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu,  or master, of all living entities; therefore
He is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. So there is no denying the fact
that the Supreme Supersoul and the individual soul are always different.

Thus the field of activities [the body], knowledge and the knowable haveCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.been summarily described by Me. Only My devotees can understand this
thoroughly and thus attain to My nature.
PURPORT
The Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable.
This knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of
knowing. Combined, these are called vijïäna,  or the science of knowledge.
Perfect knowledge can be unders tood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord
directly. Others are unable to understa nd. The monists say that at the ultimate
stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this.
Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding on eself in
Kåñëa consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon
as we transfer all consciousness to Kåñëa’s activities and realize that Kåñëa is
everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is
nothing but the p reliminary stage of understanding devotional service
perfectly. In the Fifteenth Chapter this will be very clearly explained.
Now, to summarize, one may understand that verses 6 and 7 , beginning
from mahä-bhütäni  and continuing through cetanä dhåtiù,  analyze the material
elements and certain manifestations of the symptoms of life. These combine to
form the body, or the field of a ctivities. And verses 8 through 12 , from
amänitvam  through tattva-jïänärtha-darçanam,  describe the process of
knowledge for understanding both types of  knower of the field of activities,
namely the soul and the Supersoul. Then verses 13 through 18 , beginni ng from
anädi mat-param  and continuing through hådi sarvasya viñöhitam,  describe the
soul and the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul.
Thus three items have been described: the field of activity (the body), the
process of understanding, and both the so ul and the Supersoul. It is especially
described here that only the unalloye d devotees of the Lord can understand
these three items clearly . So for these devotees Bhagavad-gétä  is fully useful; it
is they who can attain the supreme goal, the nature of the Supreme Lord,
Kåñëa. In other words, only devotees, and not others, can understand
Bhagavad-gétä  and derive the desired result.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  20

Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be

material nature.
PURPORT
By the knowledge given in this chap ter, one can understand the body (the
field of activities) and the knowers of the body (both the individual soul and
the Supersoul). The body is the field of  activity and is composed of material
nature. The individual sou l that is embodied and enjoying the activities of the
body is the puruña,  or the living entity. He is one knower, and the other is the
Supersoul. Of course, it is to be unde rstood that both the Supersoul and the
individual entity are different manifestatio ns of the Supreme Personality ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Godhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul
is in the category of His personal expansion.
Both material nature and the living en tity are eternal. That is to say that
they existed before the creation. The ma terial manifestation is from the energy
of the Supreme Lord, and so also are the living entities, but the living entities
are of the superio r energy. Both the living entities and material nature existed
before this cosmos was manifested. Ma terial nature was absorbed in the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mahä-Viñëu, and when it was required, it
was manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva.  Sim ilarly, the living entities are
also in Him, and because they are condit ioned, they are averse to serving the
Supreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. But
with the coming forth of material nature these living entities are ag ain given a
chance to act in the material world an d prepare themselves to enter into the
spiritual world. That is the mystery of  this material creation. Actually the
living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but
due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really
does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme
Lord have come in contact with mate rial nature. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the
scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are
undergoing a hard struggle for existence.  But we should know it with certainty
from the descriptions of these few verses that all transformat ions and
influences of material nature by th e three modes are also productions of
material nature. All transformations and variety in respect to living entities
are due to the body. As far as spirit is  concerned, living entities are all the
same.

TRANSLATION
Nature is said to be the cause of all material causes and effects, whereas the
living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this world.
PURPORT
The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities
are due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and
these varieties are creations of the ma terial nature. They arise from the
different sensual pleasures o f the living entity, who thus desires to live in this
body or that. When he is put into diffe rent bodies, he enjoys different kinds of
happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body,
and not to himself as he is. In his orig inal state there is no doubt of enjoyment;
therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material
nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such
thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material  world everyone is
struggling hard to acquire different kind s of pleasures for the body. It might be
more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are
instruments for gratifying desire. No w, the sum total—body and instrument
senses—are offered by material nature, and as will be clear in the next verse,
the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past
desire and activity. According to one’s desires and activities, material natureCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.places one in vario us residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his
attaining such residential quarters an d his attendant enjoyment or suffering.
Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of
nature because the body, being matter, a cts according to the laws of nature. At
that time, the living entity has no powe r to change that law. Suppose an entity
is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he
must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put
into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog.
Similarly, if the living entity is put in to the body of a demigod, he must act
according to his body. This is the law of  nature. But in all circumstances, the
Supersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas  (Muëòaka
Upaniñad  3.1.1) as follows: dvä suparëä sayujä sakhäyaù.  The Supreme Lord is so
kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul
and in all circumstance s is present as the Supersoul, or Paramätmä.

The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying
the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material
nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.
PURPORT
This verse is very important for an un derstanding of how the living entities
transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter
that the living entity is transmigrating  from one body to another just as one
changes dress. This chan ge of dress is due to his attachment to material
existence. As long as he is captivated  by this false manifestation, he has to
continue transmigrating from one body to  another. Due to his desire to lord it
over material nature, he is put into such undesira ble circumstances. Under the
influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod,
sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as
a saintly man, as a bug. This is go ing on. And in all cases the living e ntity
thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the
influence of material nature.
H o w  h e  i s  p u t  i n t o  s u c h  d i f f e r e n t  b o dies is explained here. It is due to
association with the different modes of  nature. One has to rise, therefore,
above the three material modes and be come situated in the transcendental
position. That is called Kåñëa con sciousness. Unless one is situated in Kåñëa
consciousness, his material consciousne ss will oblige him to transfer from one
body to another because he has material  desires since time immemorial. But he
has to change that conception . That change can be effec ted only by hearing
from authoritative sources. The best ex ample is here: Arjuna is hearing the
science of God from Kåñëa. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing
process, will lose his long-cherished de sire to dominate material nature, and
gradua lly and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he
comes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra  it is said that as he
becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, heCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.proportionately relishes his etern al blissful life.

TRANSLATION
Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer, who is the Lord,
the supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is
known as the Supersoul.
PURPORT
It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul,
is the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity.
Because the monist philosophers take th e knower of the body to be one, they
think that there is no  difference between the Supersoul and the individual
soul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is represented as the Paramätmä in
every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is para,
transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities  of a particular field,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in
bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer.
His name is Paramätmä, not ätmä,  and He is transcendental. It is distinctly
clear that the ätmä  and Paramätmä are different. The Supersoul, the
Paramätmä, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not.
And because the Paramätmä is the Supr eme Lord, He is present within to
sanction the individual soul’s desiring material enjoyment. Without the
sanction of the Supreme Soul, the indi vidual soul cannot do anything. The
individual is bhukta,  or the sustained, and the Lord is bhoktä,  or the
maintainer. There are innumerable living  entities, and He is staying in them
as a friend.
The fact is that every individual living  entity is eternally part and parcel of
the Supreme Lord, and both of them are ve ry intimately related as friends. But
the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord
and act independent ly in an attempt to dominate nature, and because he has
this tendency he is called the marginal  energy of the Supreme Lord. The living
entity can be situated either in the mate rial energy or in the spiritual energy.
As long as he is conditioned by the mate rial energy, the Supreme Lord, as his
friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just  to get him to return to the spiritual
energy. The Lord is always eager to take  him back to the spiritual energy, but
due to his minute independence the individual entity is co ntinually rejecting
the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of
his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always
giving instruction from within and fr om without. From without He gives
instruc tions as stated in Bhagavad-gétä,  and from within He tries to convince
the living entity that his activities in  the material field are not conducive to
real happiness. “Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be
happy,” He says. Thus t he intelligent person who places his faith in the
Paramätmä or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward
a blissful eternal life of knowledge.

Clear understanding of material nature, the Supersoul, the individual soul
and their interrelation makes one eligible  to become liberated and turn to the
spiritual atmosphere without being forced  to return to this material nature.
This is the result of kno wledge. The purpose of knowledge is to understand
distinctly that the living entity ha s by chance fallen into this material
existence. By his personal endeavor in  association with authorities, saintly
persons and a spiritual master, he has to understand hi s position and then
revert to spiritual consciousness or Kåñëa consciousness by understanding
Bhagavad-gétä  as it is explained by the Personality of Godhead. Then it is
certain that he will never come again in to this material existence; he will beCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.transfer red into the spiritual world for a blissful eternal life of knowledge.

Some perceive the Supersoul within themselves through meditation, others
through the cultivation of knowledge, and still others through working without

PURPORT
The Lord informs Arjuna that the co nditioned souls can be divided into
two classes as far as man’s search for se lf-realization is concerned. Those who
are atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual
understanding. But there are other s, who are faithful in their understanding of
spiritual life, and they are called intr ospective devotees, philosophers, and
workers who have renounced fruitive resu lts. Those who always try to establish
the doctrine of monism are also counted among the ath eists and agnostics. InCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.other words, only the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are best
situated in spiritual understanding, because they understand that beyond this
material nature are the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of
Godhe ad, who is expanded as the Paramätmä, the Supersoul in everyone, the
all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who try to understand the
Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivat ion of knowledge, and they can be
counted in the class of the faithful. The Sä ìkhya philosophers analyze this
material world into twenty-four elements , and they place the individual soul as
the twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the
individual soul to be transcendental  to the material elements, they ar e able to
understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. He is the twen ty-sixth element. Thus gradually they
also come to the standard of devotional  service in Kåñëa consciousness. Those
who work without fruitiv e results are also perfect in their attitude. They are
given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in Kåñëa
consciousness. Here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in
consciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when
they discover the Supersoul within th emselves, they become transcendentally
situated. Similarly, there are others who also try to understand the Supreme
Soul by cultivation of knowledge, an d there are others who cultivate the
haöha- yoga system and who try to satisfy th e Supreme Personality of Godhead
by childish activities.

Again there are those who, although no t conversant in spiritual knowledge,
begin to worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from others.
Because of their tendency to hear from authorities, they also transcend the path
of birth and death.
PURPORT
This verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern
society there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the
people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually
there is no knowledge of phil osophy. As for the common man, if he is a good
soul, then there is a chance for advanc ement by hearing. This hearing process
is very important. Lord Caitanya, wh o preached Kåñëa consciousness in the
modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the  common man simply
hears from authoritative sources he can progress, especially, according to Lord
Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa,
Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. It
is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from
realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The
worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya
has said that in this age no one needs to chang e his position, but one should
give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative
reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a
pure de votee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps,
one will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse
particularly, the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very
appropriate. Although th e common man is often not as capable as so-called
philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one
transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home.

are many existences which are moving, and all of them are but combinations
of material nature and the superior nature, the living entity. Without the
touch of the superior nature, the living entity, nothing can grow. The
relationship between matter and nature is eternally going on, and this
combination is effected by the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the controller of
both the superior and inferior natures. The material nature is created by Him,
and the super ior nature is placed in this ma terial nature, and thus all these

PURPORT
Anyone who by good association can see three things combined
together—the body, the proprietor of the body, or individual soul, and the
friend of the individual soul—is actu ally in knowledge. Unless one has the
association of a real knower of spiritual sub jects, one cannot see these three
things. Those who do not have such association are ignorant; they simply see
the body, and they think that when the body is destroyed everything is
finished. But actually it is not so. After the destruction of the body, bo th the
soul and the Supersoul exist, and they go on eternally in many various moving
and nonmoving forms. The Sanskrit word parameçvara  is sometimes translated
as “the individual soul” because the soul is the master of the body and after the
destruction of  the body he transfers to another form. In that way he is master.
But there are others who interpret this parameçvara  to be the Supersoul. In
either case, both the Supersoul and the individual soul continue. They are not
destroyed. One who can see in this way can actually see what is happening.

One who sees the Supersoul equally present everywhere, in every living

The living entity, by accepting his material existence, has become situated
differently than in his spiritual existence. But if one understands that the
Supreme is situated in His Paramätmä ma nifestation everywhere, that is, if one
can see the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living
thing, he does not degrade himself by a destructive mentality, and he therefore
gradually advances to the spiritual world. The mind is generally addicted to
sense gratifying processes; but when the mind tu rns to the Supersoul, one
becomes advanced in spiritual understanding.

When one can see that the various bodies  of living entities arise due to the
different desires of the individual soul and do not actually belong to the soul
itself, one actually sees. In the material conception of life, we find someone a
demigod, someone a  human being, a dog, a cat, etc. This is material vision, not
actual vision. This material differentiat ion is due to a material conception of
life. After the destruction of the material body, the spirit soul is one. The spirit
soul, due to contact with mat erial nature, gets different types of bodies. When
one can see this, he attains spiritual vision; thus being freed from
differentiations like man, animal, big, low, etc., one becomes purified in his
consciousness and able to develop Kåñëa consciousness in his spiritual identity.

The air enters into water, mud, stool and whatever else is there; still it does

TRANSLATION
O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the
living entity, one within the body, illu minate the entire body by consciousness.
PURPORT
There are various theories regarding consciousness. Here in Bhagavad-gétä
the example of the sun and the sunshine is  given. As the sun is situated in one
place but is illuminating the whole univer se, so a small particle of spirit soul,
although situated in  the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole body by
consciousness. Thus consciousness is th e proof of the presence of the soul, as
sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun. When the soul is
present in the body, there is consciousnes s all over the body, and as soon as the
soul has passed from the body there is  no more consciousness. This can be
easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore consciousness is not a
product of the combinations of ma tter. It is the symptom of the liv ing entity.
The consciousness of the living entity , although qualitatively one with the
supreme consciousness, is not supreme, because the consciousness of one
particular body does not share that of  another body. But the Supersoul, which
is situated in all  bodies as the friend of the individual soul, is conscious of all
bodies. That is the difference between supreme consciousness and individual
consciousness.

distinction between the body, the owner of the body, and the Supersoul. One
should recognize the process of liberation, as described in verses eight through
twelve . Then one can go on to th e supreme destination.
A faithful person should at first have some good association to hear of God
and thus gradually become enlightened. If one accepts a spiritual master, one
can learn to distinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes the
steppingstone for further spi ritual realization. A spiritual master, by various
instructions, teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life.
For instance, in Bhagavad-gétä  we find Kåñëa instructing Arjuna to free him
from materialistic considerations.
One can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its
twenty-four elements. The body is the gross manifestation. And the subtleCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.manifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life
are the interaction of these fe atures. But over and above this, there is the soul,
and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This
material world is working by the conjun ction of the soul and the twenty-four
material elements. One who can see the constitution o f the whole material
manifestation as this combination of th e soul and material elements and can
also see the situation of the Supreme Soul  becomes eligible for transfer to the
spiritual world. These things are mean t for contemplation and for realization,
and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of
the spiritual master.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Thirteenth Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Nature, the Enjoyer and Consciousness.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Again I shall declare to you this
supreme wisdom, the best of all knowle dge, knowing which all the sages have
attained the supreme perfection.
PURPORT
From the Seventh Chapter  to the end of the Twelfth Chapter , Çré Kåñëa in
detail reveals the Absolute Truth, th e Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now,
the Lord Himself is further enlighte ning Arjuna. If one understands this
chapter through the process of phi losophical speculation, he will come to an
understanding of devotional service. In the Thirteenth Chapter , it was clearly
explained that by humbly developing  knowledge one may possibly be freed
from material entanglement. It has also been explained that it  is due to
association with the modes of nature that  the living entity is entangled in this
material world. Now, in this chapte r, the Supreme Personality explains what
those modes of nature are, how they act, how they bind and how they give
liberation. The  knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the
Supreme Lord to be superior to the kn owledge given so far in other chapters.
By understanding this knowledge, variou s great sages attained perfection and
transferred to the spiritual world. The Lord  now explains the same knowledge
in a better way. This knowledge is far, far superior to all other processes ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.knowledge thus far explained, and know ing this many attained perfection.
Thus it is expected that one who un derstands this Fourteenth Chapter wi ll
attain perfection.

TRANSLATION
By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental
nature like My own. Thus established, one is not born at the time of creation or
disturbed at the time of dissolution.
PURPORT
After acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualitative
equality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free from the
repetition of birth and death. One does  not, however, lose his identity as an
individual soul. It is underst ood from Vedic literature that the liberated souls
who have reached the transcendental pl anets of the spiritual sky always lookCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being engaged in His transcendental
loving service. So, even after liberation, the devote es do not lose their
individual identities.
Generally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is
contaminated by the three modes of ma terial nature. Knowledge which is not
contaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental
knowledge. As soon as one is situated in that trans cendental knowledge, he is
on the same platform as the Supreme Person. Those who have no knowledge of
the spiritual sky hold that after being fr eed from the material activities of the
material form, this spiritual iden tity becomes formless, without any
variegatedness. However, just as there is material variegatedness in this world,
in the spiritual world there is also va riegatedness. Those in ignorance of this
think that spiritual existence is oppose d to material variety. But actually, in
the spiritual sky,  one attains a spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and
the spiritual situation is called devotional  life. That atmosphere is said to be
uncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To
obtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities. One who
thus develops the spiritual qualities is no t affected either by the creation or by
the destruction of the material world.

TRANSLATION
The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is
that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings,
O son of Bharata.
PURPORT
This is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to
the combination of kñetra  and kñetra-jïa,  the body and the spirit soul. This
combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the
Supreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva  is the total cause of the total cosmic
manifestation; and that total substance of the material cause, in which there
are three modes of nature, is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme
Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innum erable universes
become possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva,  is described as
Brahman in the Vedic literature ( Muëòaka Upaniñad  1.1.19 ): tasmäd etad
brahma näma-rüpam annaà ca jäyate.  The Supreme Person impregnates that
Brahman with th e seeds of the living entiti es. The twenty-four elements,
beginning from earth, water, fire and air, are all material energy, and they
constitute what is called mahad brahma,  or the great Brahman, the material
nature. As explained in the Seventh Chapter , beyond this there is another,
superior nature—the living entity. Into material nature the superior nature is
mixed by the will of the Supreme Person ality of Godhead, and thereafter all
living entities are born of this material nature.
The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the
scorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion.
Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not
the cause of the birth  of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.material nature. Thus every living entity , according to his past activities, has a
different body, created by this material natu re, so that the entity can enjoy or
suffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the
manifestations of living entities in this material world.

It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunté, are made

PURPORT
In this verse it is clearly explain ed that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kåñëa, is the original father of all living entities. The living entities
are combinations of the material nature  and the spiritual nature. Such living
entities are seen not onl y on this planet but on every planet, even on the
highest, where Brahmä is situated. Ever ywhere there are living entities; withinCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire. All these
appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and Kåñëa’s seed-giving
process. The purport is that the material world is impregnated with living
entities, who come out in various forms at the time of creation according to
their past deeds.

Material nature consists of three modes—goodness, passion and ignorance.
When the eternal living entity comes in contact with nature, O mighty-armed
Arjuna, he becomes conditioned by these modes.
PURPORT
The living entity, because he is transc endental, has nothing to do with this
material nature. Still, because he has become conditioned by the materialCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.world, he is acting under the spell of  the three modes of material nature.
Because living entities have d ifferent kinds of bodies, in terms of the different
aspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that nature. This is the
cause of the varieties of happiness and distress.

TRANSLATION
O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is
illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that
mode become conditioned by a sense of happiness and knowledge.
PURPORT
The living entities conditioned by mate rial nature are of various types. One
is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of
psychological manifestations are causes of the entities’ conditioned status inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.nature. How they are d ifferently conditioned is explained in this section of
Bhagavad-gétä.  The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of
developing the mode of goodness in th e material world is that one becomes
wiser than those otherwise co nditioned. A man in the mod e of goodness is not
so much affected by material miseries , and he has a sense of advancement in
material knowledge. The representative type is the brähmaëa,  who is supposed
to be situated in the mode of good ness. This sense of happiness is due to
understa nding that, in the mode of goodne ss, one is more or less free from
sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of
goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.
The difficulty here is that when a livi ng entity is situated in the mode of
goodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and
is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples
are the scientist and the philosopher. Each is very proud of his knowledge, and
because they generally improve their li ving conditions, they feel a sort of
material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life
makes them bound by the mode  of goodness of material nature. As such, they
are attracted toward working in the mode  of goodness, and, as long as they
have an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of
body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of
being transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly one may become a
philosopher, a scientist or a poet, and re peatedly become entangled in the same
disadvantages of birth and death. But, due to the illusion of the material
energy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant.

TRANSLATION
The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of
Kunté, and because of this the embodied living entity is bound to material
fruitive actions.
PURPORT
The mode of passion is characterize d by the attraction between man and
woman. Woman has attraction for man,  and man has attraction for woman.
This is called the mode of passion. And when the mode of passion is increased,
one develops the hankering for mate rial enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense
gratification. For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some
honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with
nice children, wife and house. These are the products of t he mode of passion.
As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard.
Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of
his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his
wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work.
Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion.
Modern civilization is considered to be  advanced in the standard of the mode
of passion. Formerly, the adv anced condition was considered to be in the mode
of goodness. If there is no liberation fo r those in the mode of goodness, what to
speak of those who are entangled in the mode of passion?Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  8

TRANSLATION
O son of Bharata, know that the mode of darkness, born of ignorance, is the
delusion of all embodied living entities.  The results of this mode are madness,
indolence and sleep, which bind the conditioned soul.
PURPORT
In this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. This
means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the
embodied soul. The mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of
goodness. In the mode of goodn ess, by development of knowledge, one can
understand what is what, but the mode  of ignorance is just the opposite.
Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a
madman cannot understand what is wh at. Instead of making advancement,
one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the Vedic literature. Vastu-yäthätmya-jïänävarakaà viparyaya-jïäna-janakaà
tamaù:  under the spell of ignorance, one ca nnot understand a thing as it is. For
example, everyone can see t hat his grandfather has died and therefore he will
also die; man is mortal. The children that  he conceives will also die. So death is
sure. Still, people are madly accumula ting money and working very hard all
day and night, not caring for the eternal spiri t. This is madness. In their
madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual
understanding. Such people are very la zy. When they are invited to associate
for spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even
active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another
symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more
than is required. Six hours of sleep is  sufficient, but a man in the mode of
ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve  hours a day. Such a man appears to be
always dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the
symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance.

O son of Bharata, the mode of goodness conditions one to happiness; passion

binds one to madness.
PURPORT
A person in the mode of goodness is satisfied by his work or intellectual
pursuit, just as a philosopher, scient ist or educator may be engaged in a
particular field of knowledge and may be satisfied in that way. A man in the
mode of passion may be engaged in fruitive activity; he owns as much as he can
and spends for good causes. Sometimes he tries to open hospitals, give to
charity institutions, etc. These are sign s of one in the mode of passion. And
the mode of ignorance covers knowledge. In the mode of i gnorance, whatever
one does is good neither for him nor for anyone.

TRANSLATION
Sometimes the mode of goodness become s prominent, defeating the modes of
passion and ignorance, O son of Bharata. Sometimes the mode of passion defeats
goodness and ignorance, and at other times ignorance defeats goodness and
passion. In this way there is always competition for supremacy.
PURPORT
When the mode of passion is prominent, the modes of goodness and
ignorance are defeated. When the mode of goodness is prominent, passion and
ignorance are defeated. And when th e mode of ignorance is prominent,
passion and goodness are defeated. This compet ition is always going on.
Therefore, one who is actually intent on advancing in Kåñëa consciousness has
to transcend these three modes. The prominence of some certain mode of
nature is manifested in one’s dealings, in his activities, in eating, etc. All th is
will be explained in later chapters. Bu t if one wants, he can develop, by
practice, the mode of goodness and thus  defeat the modes of ignorance and
passion. One can similarly develop the mode of passion and defeat goodness
and ignorance. Or one can deve lop the mode of ignorance and defeat goodness
and passion. Although there are these three modes of material nature, if one is
determined he can be blessed by the mode of goodness, and by transcending
the mode of goodness he can be situated in pure goodness , which is called the
vasudeva  state, a state in which one can unde rstand the science of God. By the
manifestation of particular activities, it can be understood in what mode of
nature one is situated.

PURPORT
One in goodness attains higher plan etary systems, like Brahmaloka or
Janoloka, and there enjoys godly happiness. The word amalän  is significant; it
means “free from the modes of passion and ignorance.” There are impurities in
the material world, but the mo de of goodness is the purest form of existence in
the material world. There are different kinds of planets for different kinds of
living entities. Those who die in the mode of goodness are elevated to the
planets where great sages and great devotees live.

Some people have the impression that  when the soul reaches the platform
of human life it never goes down again . This is incorrect. According to this
verse, if one develops the mode of igno rance, after his death he is degraded to
an animal form of life. Fro m there one has to again elevate himself, by an
evolutionary process, to come again to the human form of life. Therefore,
those who are actually serious about human life should take to the mode of
goodness and in good associat ion transcend the modes and be come situated in
Kåñëa consciousness. This is the aim of human life. Otherwise, there is no
guarantee that the human being will again attain to the human status.

TRANSLATION
The result of pious action is pure and is said to be in the mode of goodness.
But action done in the mode of passion results in misery, and action performed
in the mode of ignorance results in foolishness.
PURPORT
The result of pious activities in the mode of goodness is pure. Therefore the
sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. But activities in
the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness
is bound to be d efeated. If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so
much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built.
The financier has to take much troubl e to earn a mass of wealth, and those
who are slaving to construct the building ha ve to render physical toil. The
miseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-gétä  says that in any activity performed
under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There
may be a little so-called mental happiness—“I have this house or this
money”—but this is not actual happiness.
As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without
knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and
afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable,
although, under the spell of the illusory energy, mäyä,  the animals do not
understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of
ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal willCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In hu man society,
if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of
ignorance, people do not perceive that  there is a complete state controlled by
the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is a son of the Supreme Lord, and He
does n ot tolerate even an ant’s being killed. One has to pay for it. So
indulgence in animal killing for the tast e of the tongue is the grossest kind of
ignorance. A human being has no need  to kill animals, because God has
supplied so many nice things. If one in dulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be
understood that he is acting in ignora nce and is making his future very dark.
Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing  of cows is most vicious because the
cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Co w slaughter is an act of
the grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature ( Åg Veda  9.4.64 ) the
words gobhiù préëita-matsaram  indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by
milk, is desirous of killing the cow is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a
prayer in the Vedic literature that states:
namo brahmaëya-deväya
go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca
jagad-dhitäya kåñëäya
govindäya namo namaù
“My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the brähmaëas,  and You
are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.” ( Viñëu Puräëa
1.19.65 ) The purport is that special mentio n is given in that prayer for the
protection of the cows and the brähmaëas.  Brähmaëas  are the symbol of
spiritual education, and cows are the sy mbol of the most valuable food; these
two living creatures, the brähmaëas  and the cows, must be given all
protection—that is real advancement of civilization. In modern human
society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to
be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction
and is clearing the path to its own co ndemnation. A civilization which guides
the citizens to become  animals in their next lives is certainly not a human
civilization. The present human civilization  is, of course, grossly misled by the
modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nationsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.should take care to provide the easiest proc ess, Kåñëa consciousness, to save
humanity from the greatest danger.

From the mode of goodness, real kn owledge develops; from the mode of

PURPORT
Since the present civilization is not ve ry congenial to the living entities,
Kåñëa consciousness is recommended. Through Kåñëa consciousness, society
will develop the mode of goodness. When the mode of goodness is developed,
people will see things as they are. In the mode of ignorance, people are just like
animals and cannot see things clearly. In  the mode of ignorance, for example,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.they do not see that by killing one anim al they are taking the chance of being
killed by the same animal in the next life. Bec ause people have no education in
actual knowledge, they become irrespon sible. To stop this irresponsibility,
education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must
be there. When they are actually ed ucated in the mode of goodness, they  will
become sober, in full knowledge of thin gs as they are. Then people will be
happy and prosperous. Even if the majo rity of the people aren’t happy and
prosperous, if a certain percentage of the population develops Kåñëa
consciousness and becomes situat ed in the mode of goodness, then there is the
possibility for peace and prosperity all ov er the world. Otherwise, if the world
is devoted to the modes of passion an d ignorance, there can be no peace or
prosperity. In the mode of passion, people become gree dy, and their hankering
for sense enjoyment has no limit. One can see that even if one has enough
money and adequate arrangements for sense gratification, there is neither
happiness nor peace of mind. That is no t possible, because one is situated in
the mo de of passion. If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him;
he has to elevate himself to the mo de of goodness by practicing Kåñëa
consciousness. When one is engaged in the mode of passion, not only is he
mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also very
troublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough
money to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of
ignorance, people become mad. Being distressed by their circumstances, they
take shelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance. Their
future in life is very dark.

TRANSLATION
Those situated in the mode of goodne ss gradually go upward to the higher
planets; those in the mode of passion li ve on the earthly planets; and those in
the abominable mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.
PURPORT
In this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more
explicitly set forth. There is an uppe r planetary system, consisting of the
heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree
of development of the mode o f goodness, the living entity can be transferred to
various planets in this system. The highes t planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka,
where the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahmä, resides. We have seen
already that we can hardly calculate the wondrou s condition of life in
Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring
us to this.
The mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of
goodness and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be
purely in the mode of passion, he will simp ly remain on this earth as a king or a
rich man. But because th ere are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this
earth, in the mode of passion or ig norance, cannot forcibly approach the
higher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of
becoming mad in the next life.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The lowest quality, the mode of ignora nce, is described here as abominable.
The result of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in
material nature. Beneath the human le vel there are eight million species of
life—birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc.—and according to the development of
the mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable
conditions. The word tämasäù  is very significant here. Tämasäù  indicates
those who stay continuously in the mode of ignorance witho u t  r i s i n g  t o  a
higher mode. Their future is very dark.
There is an opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to
be elevated to the mode of goodne ss, and that system is called Kåñëa
consciousness. But one who does not ta ke advantage of this opportunity will
certainly continue in the lower modes.

PURPORT
One can transcend all the activities of  the modes of material nature simply
by understanding them properly by lear ning from the proper souls. The real
spiritual master is Kåñëa, and He is  imparting this spiritual knowledge to
Arjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in Kåñëa consciousness that
one has to learn this science of activi ties in terms of the modes of nature.
Otherwise, one’s life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide
spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spir itual position, his material
body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the
material modes of nature. He is helpless,  being in the grip of these modes, but
when he can see his real position, th en he can attain to the transcende ntal
platform, having the scope for spiritual li fe. Actually, the living entity is not
the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated
in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material
nature. Unl ess one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in
what position he is actually situated . With the association of a bona fide
spiritual master, he can see his real position, and by such an understanding he
can become fixed in full Kåñëa c onsciousness. A man in Kåñëa consciousness is
not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It has already been
stated in the Seventh Chapter  that one who has surrendered to Kåñëa is
relieved from the activities of material nature. For one w ho is able to see
things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases.

PURPORT
How one can stay in the transcendental position, even in this body, in full
Kåñëa consciousness, is explained in this verse. The Sanskrit word dehé means
“embodied.” Although one is within this  material body, by his advancement in
spiritual knowledge he ca n be free from the influence of the modes of nature.
He can enjoy the happiness of spiritual li fe even in this body because, after
leaving this body, he is certainly going to the spiritual sky. But even in this
body he can enjoy spiritual happiness. In oth er words, devotional service in
Kåñëa consciousness is the sign of liberation from material entanglement, and
this will be explained in the Eighteenth Chapter . When one is freed from the
influence of the modes of material nature, he enters into devotional service.

Arjuna inquired: O my dear Lord, by which symptoms is one known who is

transcend the modes of nature?
PURPORT
In this verse, Arjuna’s questions are very appropriate. He wants to know the
symptoms of a person who has alread y transcended the material modes. He
first inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person. How can one
understand that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of
material nature? The second question asks how he lives and what his activities
are. Are they regulated or nonregulated ? Then Arjuna inquires of the means
by which he can attain the transcendental nature. That is ve ry important.
Unless one knows the direct means by  which one can be situated always
transcendentally, there is no possibility  of showing the symptoms. So all these
questions put by Arjuna are very important, and the Lord answers them.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXTS  22–25

material activities—such a person is said to have transcended the modes of
nature.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT
Arjuna submitted three different questions , and the Lord answers them one
after another. In these verses, Kåñëa first indicates that a person
transcendentally situated has no envy  and does not hanker for anything.
When a living entity stays in this materia l world embodied by the material
body, it  is t o be underst ood t h at  h e is under the control of one of the three
modes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out
of the clutches of the material mo des of nature. But as long as he is not out of
the material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the
devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will
automatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he
acts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to
Kåñëa, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material
body, and he does not need to accept th e dictations of the material body. The
qualities of the material modes i n the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is
aloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to
enjoy the body, nor does he desire to  get out of it. Thus transcendentally
situated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become
free from the influence of the modes of material nature.
The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated
person. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and
dishonor offered to the body, but the tr anscendentally situated person is not
affected by such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in Kåñëa
consciousness and does not mind whethe r a man honors or dishonors him. He
accepts things that are favorable for his duty in Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise
he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or g old. He takes
everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of Kåñëa
consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed
and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he
has nothing to d o with material existence. Social and political issues do not
affect him, because he knows the si tuation of temporary upheavals and
disturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attemptCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.anything for Kåñëa, but for his personal self he  does not attempt anything. By
such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated.

One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at
once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of
Brahman.
PURPORT
This verse is a reply to Arjuna’s third question : What is the means of
attaining to the transcendental positi on? As explained before, the material
world is acting under the spell of the mo des of material nature. One should not
be disturbed by the activitie s of the modes of nature; instead of putting his
consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to Kåñëa
activities. Kåñëa activities are known as bhakti-yoga —always acting for Kåñëa.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.This includes not only Kåñëa, but His different p lenary expansions such as
Räma and Näräyaëa. He has innumerabl e expansions. One who is engaged in
the service of any of the forms of Kå ñëa, or of His plenary expansions, is
considered to be transcendentally situat ed. One should also note that all the
forms  of Kåñëa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal.
Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they
possess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service of
Kåñëa or His plenary expans ions with unfailing determination, although these
modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, one can overcome
them easily. This has alre ady been explained in the Seventh Chapter . One
who surrenders unto Kåñëa at on ce surmounts the influence o f the modes of
material nature. To be in Kåñëa consciousness or in devotional service means
to acquire equality with Kåñëa. The Lo rd says that His nature is eternal,
blissful and full of knowledge, and the livi ng entities are part and parcel of the
Supreme , as gold particles are part of a gold  mine. Thus the living entity, in his
spiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as Kåñëa in quality. The difference
of individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question of
bhakti-yoga.  Bhakti-yoga  mea ns that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and
the activity of exchange of love betw een the Lord and the devotee is there.
Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise  there would be
no meaning to bhakti-yoga.  If one is not situated in the same transcendental
position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal
assistant to a king, one must acquire th e qualifications. Thus the qualification
is to become Brahman, or freed from all ma terial contamination. It is said in
the Vedic literature, brahmaiva san brahmäpy eti.  One can attain the Supreme
Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively
become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his
eternal Brahman identity as an individual soul.

TRANSLATION
And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is immortal,
imperishable and eternal and is the constitutional position of ultimate
happiness.
PURPORT
The constitution of Brahman is immort ality, imperishability, eternity, and
happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization.
Paramätmä, the Supersoul, is the middl e, the second stage in transcendental
realization, and the Supreme Personali ty of Godhead is the ultimate realization
of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Paramätmä and the impersonal
Brahman are within the Supreme Pe rson. It is explained in the Seventh
Chapter  that material nature is the manife station of the inferior energy of the
Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with
fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material
nature. When a living entity conditione d by this material nature begins the
cultivation of spiritual  knowledge, he elevates himself from the position ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the
Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage
in self-realization. At this stage the Brahman-rea lized person is transcendental
to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization.
If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then
gradually rise up to Paramätmä realization and then to the realization of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic
literature. The four Kumäras were situ ated first in the impersonal Brahman
conception of truth, but then they grad ually rose to the platform of devotional
service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of
Brahman runs the risk of falling down. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is stated that
although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going
further, with no information of the Supreme Perso n, his intelligence is not
perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform,
there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional
service of the Lord. In the Vedic  language it is also said, raso vai saù, r asaà hy
eväyaà labdhvänandé bhavati:  “When one understands the Personality of
Godhead, the reservoir of pleasure, Kåñëa, he actually becomes
transcendentally blissful.” ( Taittiréya Upaniñad  2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full
in six opulences, and when a devot ee approaches Him there is an exchange of
these six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level
with the king. And so eternal happiness,  imperishable happiness, and eternal
life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of  Brahman, or
eternity, or imperishability, is included in devotional service. This is already
possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.
The living entity, although Brahman by  nature, has the desire to lord it
over the material world, and due to th is he falls down. In his constitutional
position, a living entity is above th e three modes of material nature, but
association with material natu re entangles him in the different modes of
material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of
these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By
engagement in devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness, he  is
immediately situated in the transcendent al position, and his unlawful desire toCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional
service, beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering—the prescribed nine
methods for realizing dev otional service—should be practiced in the
association of devotees. Gradually, by such  association, by the influence of the
spiritual master, one’s material desire  to dominate is removed, and one
becomes firmly situated in the Lord’s transcendental loving service. This
method is prescribed from the twenty-second  to the last verse of this chapter.
Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the
service of the Lord, should eat the remnan ts of foodstuffs offered to the Deity,
smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the
Lord had His transcendental pastimes, re ad of the different activities of the
Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the
transcendental vibration Hare K åñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/
Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days
commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His
devotees. By following such a proce ss one becomes completely detached fr om
all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti  or
the different varieties of the Brahman conception is equal to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in quality.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is said that there is an
imperishable banyan tree that has its roots upward and its branches down and
whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of
the Vedas.
PURPORT
After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga,  one may question,
“What about the Vedas ?” It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of
Vedic study is to understand Kåñëa. Therefore one who is in Kåñëa
consciousness, who is engaged in devotion al service, already knows the Vedas.
The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree.
For one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyanCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.tree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree
of this material world has  no end, and for one who is attached to this tree,
there is no possibility of liberation . The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating
oneself, are called the leaves of this tr ee. This tree’s roots grow upward because
they begin from where Brahmä is located, the t opmost planet of this universe.
If one can understand this indestructible  tree of illusion, then one can get out
of it.
This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it
has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the
material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter , we have seen that
devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic
principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and
attachment to the transcendental servic e of the Lord. The process of breaking
attachment to the material world is discussed in the begin ning of this chapter.
The root of this material existence gr ows upward. This means that it begins
from the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe.
From there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches,
representing th e various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of
the living entities’ activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense
gratification and liberation.
Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its
branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be
found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect
upon the water with  their branches down and r oots up. In other words, the
tree of this material world is only a refl ection of the real tree of the spiritual
world. This reflection of the spiritual worl d is situated on desire, just as a tree’s
reflection is situated on water.  Desire is the cause of things’ being situated in
this reflected material light. One wh o wants to get out of this material
existence must know this tree thorough ly through analytical study. Then he
can cut off his relationship with it.
This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica.
Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahman to
be the root of this material tree, an d from the root, according to SäìkhyaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.philosophy, come prakåti, puruñ a, then the three guëas,  then the five gross
elements ( païca-mahä-bhüta ), then the ten senses ( daçendriya ), mind, etc. In
this way they divide up the whole mate rial world into twenty-four elements. If
Brahman is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a
manifestation of the center by 18 0 degrees, and the other 180 degrees
constitute the spiritual world. The material world is the perverted reflection,
so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality. The
prakåti  is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the puruña  is the
Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in Bhagavad-gétä.  Since this
manifestation is material, it is temporar y. A reflection is temporary, for it is
sometimes seen and sometimes not see n. But the origin from whence the
reflection is reflected is eternal. The ma terial reflection of the real tree has to
be cut off. When it is s aid that a person knows the Vedas,  it is assumed that he
knows how  to cut off attachment to this material world. I f one knows that
process, he actually knows the Vedas.  One who is attracted by the ritualistic
formulas of the Vedas  is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He
does not exactly know the purpose of the Vedas.  The purpose of the Vedas,  as
disclosed by the Personality of Godhead Hi mself, is to cut down this reflected
tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world.

TRANSLATION
The branches of this tree extend do wnward and upward, nourished by the
three modes of material nature. The tw igs are the objects of the senses. This
tree also has roots going down, and thes e are bound to the fruitive actions of
human society.
PURPORT
The description of the banyan tree is  further explained here. Its branches
spread in all directions. In the lower pa rts, there are variegated manifestations
of living entities—human beings, animals, horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc. These
are situated on the lower parts of the branches, wh ereas on the upper parts are
higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas and many other
higher species of life. As a tree is nour ished by water, so this tree is nourished
by the three modes of material nature. S ometimes we find that a tract of land
is barren for want of sufficient water, and sometimes a tract is very green;
similarly, where particular modes of material nature are proportionately
greater in quantity, the different species of life are manifested ac cordingly.
The twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By
development of the different modes of na ture we develop different senses, and
by the senses we enjoy different variet ies of sense objects. The tips of the
branches are the senses—the ears, no se, eyes, etc.—which are attached to the
enjoyment of different sense objects. Th e twigs are sound, form, touch, and so
on—the sense objects. The subsidiary roots are attachments and aversions,
which are byproducts of different varieties of suffering and s ense enjoyment.
The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to develop from these
secondary roots, which spread in a ll directions. The real root is fromCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Brahmaloka, and the other roots are in the human planetary systems. After
one enjoys the res ults of virtuous activities in  the upper planetary systems, he
comes down to this earth and renews his karma,  or fruitive activities for
promotion. This planet of human beings is considered the field of activities.

TRANSLATION
The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can
understand where it ends, where it begins , or where its foundation is. But with
determination one must cut down this strongly rooted tree with the weapon of
detachment. Thereafter, on e must seek that place from which, having gone, one
never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead
from whom everything began and from whom everything has extended since
time immemorial.
PURPORT
It is now clearly stated that the re al form of this banyan tree cannot be
understood in this material world. Sinc e the root is upwards, the extension of
the real tree is at the other end. When  entangled with the material expansions
of the tree, one cannot see how far the tree extends, nor can one see the
beginning of this tree. Yet one has to fi nd out the cause. “I am the son of my
father, my father is the son of such-and-such a person, etc.” By searching in
this way, one comes to Brahmä, who is generated b y the Garbhodakaçäyé
Viñëu. Finally, in this way, when one reaches the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, that is the end of research wo rk. One has to search out that origin of
this tree, the Supreme Personality of  Godhead, through the association of
persons who are in knowledge of that Supr eme Personality of Godhead. Then
by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false reflection of
reality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and actually become
situated in the real tree.
The word asaìga  is very important in this connection because the
attachment for sense enjoyment and lordin g it over the material nature is very
strong. Therefore one must learn detachme nt by discussion of spiritual science
based on authoritative scriptures , and one must hear from persons who are
actually in knowledge. As a result of  such discussion in the association of
devotees, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the firstCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.thing one must do is surrender to  Him. The description of that pl ace whence
having gone one never returns to this false reflected tree is given here. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñë a, is the original root from whom
everything has emanated. To gain favor of that Personality of Godhead, one
has only to surrender,  and this is a result of performing devotional service by
hearing, chanting, etc. He is the cause of the extension of the material world.
This has already been explain ed by the Lord Himself. Ahaà sarvasya
prabhavaù : “I am the origin of everything.” Therefo re to get out of the
entanglement of this strong banyan tree of material life, one must surrender to
Kåñëa. As soon as one surrenders unto Kåñëa, one becomes detached
automatically from this material extension.

Those who are free from false prestige, illusion and false association, whoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.understand the eternal, who are done with  material lust, who are freed from the
dualities of happiness and distress, and who, unbewildered, know how to
surrender unto the Supreme P erson attain to that eternal kingdom.
PURPORT
The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first
qualification is that one should no t be deluded by pride. Because the
conditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is
very difficult for him to surrender u nto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of
material nature; the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead is the Lord. When one is
free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of  surrender. For
one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not
possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for
although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the
foolish notio n that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things
complicated, and he is always in tr ouble. The whole world moves under this
impression. People are considering the land, this earth, to belong to human
society, and they have divided the land unde r the false impression that they
are the proprietors. One has to get out of  this false notion that human society
is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he
becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial , social and
national affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world.
After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate
knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And
when one  has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all
dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He
becomes full in knowledge; then it is  possible for him to surrender to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by
fire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.
PURPORT
The spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Kåñëa—which is known as Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana—is described here.
In the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity,
because all the planets are self -luminous. We have only one planet in this
universe, the sun, which is self-luminous,  but all the planets in the spiritual sky
are self-luminous. The shining effulg ence of all those planets (called
Vaikuëöhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahm ajyoti.  Actually,
the effulgence is emanating from the pl anet of Kåñëa, Goloka Våndävana. Part
of that shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva,  the material world.
Other than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual
planet s, which are called Vaikuëöhas, chief of which is Goloka Våndävana.
As long as a living entity is in this da rk material world, he is in conditionalCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.life, but as soon as he reaches the sp iritual sky by cutting through the false,
perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no
chance of his comi ng back here. In his conditional life, the living entity
considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state
he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes an associate of the Supreme
Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, e ternal life, and full knowledge.
One should be captivated by this info rmation. He should desire to transfer
himself to that eternal world and extricat e himself from this false reflection of
reality. For one who is too much attached  to this material world, it is very
difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to Kåñëa consciousness there is
a chance of gradually becoming detach ed. One has to associate himself with
devotees, those who are in Kåñëa cons ciousness. One should search out a
society dedicated to Kåñëa consciousness and lear n how to discharge
devotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material
world. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world
simply by dressing himself in saffron cl oth. He must become attached to the
devotio nal service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that
devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter  is the only way to get
out of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen  the
contamination of all kinds of  processes by material nature is described. Only
devotional service is described as purely transcendental.
The words paramaà mama  are very important here. Actually every nook
and corner is the property of the Su preme Lord, but the spiritual world is
paramam,  full of six opulences. The Kaöha Upaniñad  (2.2.15 ) also confirms that
in the spiritual world there is no  need of sunshine, moonshine or stars ( na
tatra süryo bhäti na candratärakam ), for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated
by the internal potency of the Supr eme Lord. That supreme abode can be
achieved only by surrender and by no other means.

The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts.
Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which

PURPORT
In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living
entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord—eternally. It is
not that he assumes individuality in hi s conditional life and in his liberated
state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is
clearly said, sanätanaù.  According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord
manifests and expands Himself in i nnumerable expansions, of which the
primary expansions are called viñëu-tattva  and the secondary  expansions are
called the living entities. In other words, the viñëu-tattva  is the personal
expansion, and the living entities are the separated expansions. By His
personal expansion, He is manifested  in various forms like Lord Räma,
Nåsiàhadeva, Viñëumür ti and all the predominatin g Deities in the VaikuëöhaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors.
The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
individual identities of the Godhead, are always prese nt. Similarly, the
separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental
parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental
portions of His qualities, of which inde pendence is one. Every living entity, as
an individual soul, has his personal  individuality and a minute form of
independence. By misuse of that in dependence one becomes a conditioned
soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case,
he is qualitatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is
freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of
transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated
by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transc endental loving
service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his
existence in the material world.
The living entities, not only human be ings and the cats and dogs, but even
the greater controllers of the material world—Brahmä, Lord Çiva and even
Viñëu—are all parts and parcels of the Su preme Lord. They are all eternal, not
temporary manifestations. The  word karñati  (“struggling” or “grappling hard”)
is very significant. The conditioned so ul is bound up, as though shackled by
iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent
which is driving him in this  material existence. Whe n the mind is in the mode
of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion,
his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance,
he travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this v erse, that the
conditioned soul is covered by the ma terial body, with the mind and the
senses, and when he is liberated this  material covering perishes, but his
spiritual body manifests itself in its individual capacity. The following
information is there in the Mädhyandinäyana-çruti:  sa vä eña brahma-niñöha
idaà çaréraà martyam atisåjya brahmäb hisampadya brahmaëä paçyati brahmaëä
çåëoti brahmaëaivedaà sarvam anubhavati.  It is stated here that when a living
entity gives up this material embodiment and enter s into the spiritual world,
he revives his spiritual body, and in hi s spiritual body he can see the SupremeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to
face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. From småti  also
it is understood, vasanti yatra puruñäù sarve vaikuëöha-mürtayaù:  in the
spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies  featured like the Supreme Personality
of Godhead’s. As far as bodily constructi on is concerned, there is no difference
between the part- and-parcel living entities and the expansions of viñëu-mürti.
In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The words mamaiväàçaù  (“fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme
Lord”) are also very significant. The fr agmental portion of the Supreme Lord is
not like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second
Chapter  that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not
materially conceived. It is not like matter, which can be cut into pieces and
joined together again. That conception is not applicable here, because the
Sanskrit word sanätana  (“eternal”) is used. The fragmental por tion is eternal.
It is also stated in the beginning of th e Second Chapter that in each and every
individual body the fragmental portio n of the Supreme Lord is present ( dehino
’smin yathä dehe ). That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily
entang lement, revives its original spiritua l body in the spiritual sky in a
spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however,
understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of
the Supreme Lord, is qualit atively one with the Lord , just as the parts and
parcels of gold are also gold.

TRANSLATION
The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of
life from one body to another as the air carries aromas. Thus he takes one kind
of body and again quits it to take another.
PURPORT
Here the living entity is described as éçvara,  the controller of his own body.
If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can
move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body
undergoes depends upon him . At the time of death, the consciousness he has
created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his
consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat’s or dog’s
body. And if he has fixed his consciousness on godly q ualities, he will change
into the form of a demigod. And if he is in Kåñëa consciousness, he will be
transferred to Kåñëaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with Kåñëa. It
is a false claim that after the annihila tion of this body everything is f inished.
The individual soul is transmigrating  from one body to another, and his
present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One
gets a different body according to karma,  and he has to quit this body in due
course. It is stated  here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of
the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of
transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is
called karñati,  or struggle for existence.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  9

The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of

In other words, if the living entity adulterates his consciousness with the
qualities of cats and dogs, in his next life he gets a cat or dog body and enjoys.

color, it change s. Similarly, consciousness is pure , for the spirit soul is pure. But
consciousness is changed according to th e association of the material qualities.

The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can

PURPORT
The word jïäna-cakñuñaù  is very significant. Without knowledge, one
cannot understand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what form

from Bhagavad-gétä  and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritualCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.master. One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every
living entity is quitting his body under certain circumstanc es, he is living
under certain circumstances, and he is  enjoying under certain circumstances
under the spell of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of
happiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are
everlastingly fooled by lust and desire  lose all power to understand their
change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend
it. Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the
spirit is different from the b ody and is changing its body and enjoying in
different ways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the
conditioned living entity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore
those who are highly developed in Kåñëa consciousness try their best  to give
this knowledge to the people in general,  for their conditional life is very much
troublesome. They should come out of it and be Kåñëa conscious and liberate
themselves to transfer to the spiritual world.

The endeavoring transcendentalists, who are situated in self-realization, can
see all this clearly. But those whose minds are not developed and who are not
situated in self-realization cannot see what is taking place, though they may try
to.
PURPORT
There are many transcendentalists on the path of spiritual self-realization,
but one who is not situated in self-r ealization cannot see how things are
changing in the body of the living entity. The word yoginaù  is significant in
this connection. In the pre sent day there are many so-called yogés,  and there
are many so-called associations of yogés,  but they are actually blind in the
matter of self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic
exercise and are satisfied if the body is well bu ilt and healthy. They have no
other information. They are called yatanto ’py akåtätmänaù.  Even though they
are endeavoring in a so-called yoga system, they are not self-realized. Such
people cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul. Only
those who are actually in the yoga system and have realized the self, the world,
and the Supreme Lord—in other words, the bhakti-yogés,  those engaged in
pure devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness—can understand how things
are taking place.

The splendor of the sun, which dissipa tes the darkness of this whole world,
comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also
from Me.
PURPORT
The unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. But one
can begin to be established in knowledge by understanding what the Lord
explains here. Everyone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity. One should
simply try to understand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the
moon, and the splendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In such a conc eption of life, the beginning of Kåñëa
consciousness, lies a great deal of advancement for the conditio ned soul in this
material world. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the
Supreme Lord, and He is giving herewith  the hint how they can come back to
Godhead, back to home.
From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole
solar system. There are different univer ses and solar systems, and there are
different suns, moons and planets also, but in each universe there is only one
sun. As stated in Bhagavad- gétä (10.21 ), the moon is one of the stars
(nakñaträëäm ahaà çaçé ). Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the
spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of
human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their fo odstuff, they set fire
to start the factories, etc. So many th i n g s  a r e  d o n e  w i t h  t h e  h e l p  o f  f i r e .Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight ar e so pleasing to the living entities.
Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can understand that the
light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, then one’s Kåñëa consciousness will begin. By
the moonshine, all the vegetables are no urished. The moonshine is so pleasing
that people can easily u nderstand that they are living by the mercy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñë a. Without His mercy there cannot be
sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there
cannot be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire,  no one can live.
These are some thoughts to provoke Kå ñëa consciousness in the conditioned
soul.

It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the
energy of the Lord. The Lord enters in to every atom, every planet, and every
living being. That is discussed in the Brahma-saàhitä.  It is said there that one
plenary portion of the S upreme Personality of Godhead, Paramätmä, enters
into the planets, the universe, the livi ng entity, and even into the atom. So
due to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit
soul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is
out of the body and the body is dead, the body sinks. Of course when it is
decomposed it floats just like straw an d other things, but as soon as the man is
dead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are f loating in
space, and this is due to the entrance  of the supreme energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. His energy is  sustaining each planet, just like a
handful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of
the dust’s fall ing, but if one throws it in th e air it will fall down. Similarly,
these planets, which are floating in the air, are actually held in the fist of the
universal form of the Supreme Lord. By  His strength and energy, all moving
and nonmoving things stay in th eir place. It is said in the Vedic hymns that
because of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the sun is shining and the
planets are steadily moving. Were it not for Him, all the planets would scatter,
like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it is due to th e Supreme Personality of
Godhead that the moon nourishes all ve getables. Due to the moon’s influence,
the vegetables become delicious. With out the moonshine, the vegetables can
neither grow nor taste succulent. Human so ciety is working, living comfortably
and enjoying food due to the suppl y from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise,
mankind could not survive. The word rasätmakaù  is very significant.
Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme Lord through the
influence of the moon.

I am the fire of digestion in the bodies of all living entities, and I join with

PURPORT
According to Äyur-vedic çästra,  we understand that there is a fire in the
stomach which digests all food sent there.  When the fire is not blazing there is
no hunger, and when the fire is in order we become hungry. Sometimes when
the fire is not going nicel y, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is
representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras
(Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad  5.9.1) also confirm that the Supreme Lord or
Brahman is situated in the form of  fire within the stomach and is digesting all
kinds of foodstuff ( ayam agnir vaiçvänaro yo ’yam antaù puruñe yenedam annaà
pacyate ). Therefore since He is helping the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff,
the living entity is not independent in  the eating process. Unless the Supreme
Lord helps him in digesting, there is no possibility of eating. He thus producesCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.and digests foodstuff, and by His grace we are enjoying life. In the
Vedänta-sütra  (1.2.27 ) this is also confirmed. Çabdädibhyo ’ntaù pratiñöhänäc ca:
the Lord is situated within s ound and within the body, within the air and even

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The Supreme Lord is situated as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart, and it is
from Him that all activities are initiat ed. The living entity forgets everything
of his past life, but he has to act a ccording to the direction of the Supreme
Lord, who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to
his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is
given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only
all-pervading; He is also localized in eve ry individual heart. He awards the
different fruitive results. He is wo rshipable not only as the impersonal
Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Paramätmä,
but as the form of the incarnation of the Vedas  as well. The Vedas  give th e
right direction to people so that they can properly mold their lives and come
back to Godhead, back to home. The Vedas  offer knowledge of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and Kå ñëa in His incarnation as Vyäsadeva is
the compiler of the Vedänta- sütra.  The commentation on the Vedänta-sütra  by
Vyäsadeva in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  gives the real understanding of
Vedänta-sütra.  The Supreme Lord is so full th at for the deliverance of the
conditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the  witness of his
activity, and the giver of knowledge in the form of Vedas  and as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, the teacher of the Bhagavad-gétä.  He is
worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.
Antaù-praviñöaù çästä janänäm.  The living entity forgets as soon as he quits
his present body, but he begins his work  again, initiated by the Supreme Lord.
Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work
where he ended his last l ife. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in
this world according to the dictation fr om the Supreme Lord situated locally in
the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand the Vedas  from Him.
If one is serious about understanding the Vedic knowledge, then Kåñëa gives
the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for
understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand
Kåñëa. Vedic literature confirms this: yo ’sau sarvair vedair géyate.  In all Ve dic
literature, beginning from the four Vedas, Vedänta-sütra  and the Upaniñads
and Puräëas,  the glories of the Supreme Lord  are celebrated. By performance
of Vedic rituals, discussion of the Vedic  philosophy and worship of the Lord inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.devotional service, H e is attained. Therefore the purpose of the Vedas  is to
understand Kåñëa. The Vedas  give us direction by which to understand Kåñëa
and the process of realizing Him. The ul timate goal is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Vedänta-sütra  (1.1.4) confirms thi s in the following words: tat tu
samanvayät.  One can attain perfection in three stages. By understanding
Vedic literature one can understand his relationship with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, by performing the different processes one can
approach Hi m, and at the end one can att ain the supreme goal, who is no
other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the purpose of
the Vedas,  the understanding of the Vedas,  and the goal of the Vedas  are
clearly defined.

There are two classes of beings, the falli ble and the infallible. In the material
world every living entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every living entity
is called infallible.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT
As already explained, the Lord in Hi s incarnation as Vyäsadeva compiled
the Vedänta-sütra.  Here the Lord is giving, in  summary, the contents of the
Vedänta-sütra.  He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be
divided into two classes—the fa llible and the infallible. The living entities are
eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
When they are in contact with th e material world they are called jéva-bhüta,
and the Sanskrit words given here, kñaraù sarväëi b hütäni,  mean that they are
fallible. Those who are in oneness with  the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
however, are called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no
individuality, but that there is no di sunity. They are all agreeable to the
purpo se of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world there is no such thing
as creation, but since the Supreme Person ality of Godhead, as stated in the
Vedänta-sütra,  is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.
According to the statement of the Su preme Personality of Godhead, Lord
Kåñëa, there are two classes of living entities. The Vedas  give evidence of this,
so there is no doubt about it. The livi ng entities who are struggling in this
world with the mind and f ive senses have their material bodies, which are
changing. As long as a living entity is conditioned, his body changes due to
contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be
changing. But in the spiritua l world the body is not m ade of matter; therefore
there is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six
changes—birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and
vanishing. These are the changes of th e material body. But in the spiritual
world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is
no death. There all exists in oneness. Kñaraù sarväëi bhütäni:  any living entity
who has come in contact with matter, be ginning from the first created being,
Brahmä, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all
fallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.

Besides these two, there is the greatest  living personality, the Supreme Soul,
the imperishable Lord Himself, who has entered the three worlds and is
maintaining them.
PURPORT
The idea of this verse is very nicely expressed in the Kaöha Upaniñad
(2.2.13 ) and Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (6.13). It is clearly stated there that above
the innumerable living entities, some of whom are conditioned and some of
whom are liberated, there is th e Supreme Personality, who is Paramätmä. The
Upaniñadic verse runs as follows: nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm.  The
purport is that amongst all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated,
there is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Perso nality of Godhead,
who maintains them and gives them all the facility of enjoyment according to
different work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s
heart as Paramätmä. A wise man who can understand Him is eligible to at in
perfect  peace, not others.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  18

Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and

PURPORT
No one can surpass the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead, Kåñëa—neither
the conditioned soul nor the liberated soul. He is therefore the greatest of
personalities. Now it is clear here th at the living entities and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead are indivi duals. The difference is that the living
entities, either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state, cannot
surpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. It is incorrect to th ink of the Supreme Lord and the  living entitiesCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.as being on the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question
of superiority and inferiority betw een their personalities. The word uttama  is
very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The word loke signifies “in the pauruña ägama  (the småti  scriptures).” As
confirmed in the Nirukti  dictionary, lokyate vedärtho ’nena:  “The purpose of
the Vedas  is explained by the småti  scriptures.”
The Supreme Lord, in His localized aspe ct of Paramätmä, is also described
in the Vedas  themselves. The following verse appears in the Vedas  (Chändogya
Upaniñad  8.12.3 ): tävad eña samprasädo ’smäc charérät samutthäya paraà
jyoti-rüpaà sampadya svena rüpeëäb hiniñpadyate sa uttamaù puruñaù.  “The
Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahmajyoti;  then in
His form He remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme is called the
Supreme Personality.” This means that the Supreme Personality is exh ibiting
and diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That
Supreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Paramätmä. By incarnating
Himself as the son of Satyavaté and Pa räçara, He explains the Vedic knowledge
as Vyäsadeva .

PURPORT
There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional
position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this
verse the Supreme Personality of Godh ead clearly explains that anyone who
knows Lord Kåñëa to be the Supreme Pers on is actually the knower of
everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the
Absolute Truth, but the perfect knowe r, without wasting his valuable time,
engages directly in Kåñëa consciousness,  the devotional service of the Supreme
Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-gétä,  this fact is being stressed at
every step. And still there are so  many stubborn commentators on
Bhagavad-gétä  who consider the Supreme Ab solute Truth and the living
entities to be one and the same.
Vedic knowledge is called çruti,  learning by aural reception. One should
actually receive the Vedic message fr om authorities like Kåñëa and His
representatives. Here Kåñëa distinguishes everything very nicely, and one
should hear from this source. Simply t o hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one
m u s t  b e  a b l e  t o  u n d e r s t a n d  f r o m  t h e  authorities. It is not that one should
simply speculate academically. On e should submissively hear from
Bhagavad-gétä  that these living entities are always subordinate to the S upreme
Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, knows the purpose of the
Vedas;  no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas.
The word bhajati  is very significant. In many places the word bhajati  is
expressed in relationship with the serv ice of the Supreme Lord. If a person isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.engaged in full Kåñëa consciousness, in th e devotional service of the Lord, it is
to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the
Vaiñëava paramparä it is said that if on e is engaged in the devotional service of
Kåñëa, then there is no need for any other spiritual process for understanding
the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already co me to the point, because he is
engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary
processes of understanding. But if an yone, after speculating for hundreds of
thousands of lives, does not come to  the point that Kåñëa is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation
for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time.

This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and

The Lord clearly explains here that th is is the substance of all revealed
scriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in
transcendental knowledge. In other wo rds, by understanding this philosophy
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental
service, everyone can become freed fr om all contaminations of the modes of
material nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understa nding.
Wherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot
coexist. Devotional service to the Lord  and the Lord Himself are one and the
same because they are spiritual; devotional service takes place within the
internal energy of the Supr eme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and
ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of
darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper
guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no  question of ignorance.
Everyone must take to this consciousn ess of Kåñëa and engage in devotional
service to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of
understanding Kåñëa and engages in devo tional service, however intelligent he
may be in the estimati on of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.
The word anagha,  by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha,  “O
sinless one ,” means that unless one is free from  all sinful reactions it is very
difficult to understand Kåñëa. One has to become free from all contamination,
all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure
and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically
comes to the stage of sinlessness .
While one is performing devotional service in the association of pure
devotees in full Kåñëa consciousness, there are certain things which require to
be vanquished altogether. The most im portant thing one has to surmount is
weakness of the heart. The first  falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over
material nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the
Supreme Lord. The second weakness of th e heart is that as one increases the
propensity to lord it over material nature, he becomes  attached to matter andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.svädhyäyas tapa ärjavam

PURPORT
In the beginning  of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material
world was explained. The extra roots comi ng out of it were compared to the
activities of the living entities, some  auspicious, some inauspicious. In the
Ninth Chapter , also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras,  the ungodly, or
demons, were explained. Now, according to  Vedic rites, activities in the mode
of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation,
and such activities are known as daivé prakåti,  trans cendental by nature. Those
who are situated in the transcendental  nature make progress on the path of
liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on
the other hand, there is no possibility  of liberation. Either they will hav e to
remain in this material world as huma n beings, or they will descend among the
species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter  the Lord
explains both the transcendental nature  and its attendant qualities and the
demoniac nature a nd its qualities. He also explains the advantages and
disadvantages of these qualities.
The word abhijätasya  in reference to one born of transcendental qualities
or godly tendencies is very significant.  To beget a child in a godly atmosphere
is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhädhäna-saàskära. If the parents
want a child in the godly qua lities they should follow the ten principles
recommended for the social life of the human being. In Bhagavad-gétä  we have
studied also before that sex life for bege tting a good child is Kåñëa Himself. Sex
life is not condemned, provided the process is used  in Kåñëa consciousness.
Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness at  least should not beget children like
cats and dogs but should beget them so  that they may become Kåñëa conscious
after birth. That should be the advant age of children born of a father andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.mother absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness.
The social institution known as varëäçrama-dharma —the institution
dividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational
divisions or castes—is not meant to divide human society according to birth.
Such divisions are in terms of educatio nal qualifications. They are to keep the
society in a state of peace and prosperi ty. The qualities mentioned herein are
explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in
spiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from th e material world.
In the varëäçrama  institution the sannyäsé,  or the person in the renounced
order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social
statuses and orders. A brähmaëa  is considered to be the spiritual master of the
three other sec tions of a society, namely, the kñatriyas,  the vaiçyas  and the
çüdras,  but a sannyäsé,  who is on the top of the inst itution, is considered to be
the spiritual master of the brähmaëas  also. For a sannyäsé,  the first
qualification should be fearlessness. Bec ause a sannyäsé  has to be alone without
any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  If one thinks, “After I leave my
connections, who will protect me?” he  should not accept the renounced order
of life. One must be fully convinced that Kåñëa or the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in His localized aspect as Pa ramätmä is always within, that He is
seeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus
h a v e  f i r m  c o n v i c t i o n  t hat Kåñëa as Paramätmä will take care of a soul
surrendered to Him. “I shall never be al one,” one should think. “Even if I live
in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kåñëa, and He will
give me all protection.” That conviction is call ed abhayam,  fearlessness. This
state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life.
Then he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and
regulations to be followed in the renounce d order of life. Most important of all,
a sannyäsé  is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a
woman. He is even forbidden to talk  with a woman in a secluded place. Lord
Caitanya was an ideal sannyäsé,  and when He was at Puré His feminine
devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised
to bow down from a distant place. Th is is not a sign of hatred for wom en as aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyäsé  not to have close
connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a
particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyäsé,  intimate
relations with wome n and possession of wealth for sense gratification are
strictly forbidden. The ideal sannyäsé  was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can
learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is
considered to be the most liberal incarnatio n of Godhead, accepting the most
fallen conditioned souls, He strictly fo llowed the rules and regulations of the
sannyäsa  order of life in connection with association with woman. One of His
personal associates, namely Choöa Haridäsa, was associated with Lo rd
Caitanya along with His other confiden tial personal associates, but somehow
or other this Choöa Haridäsa looked  lustily on a young woman, and Lord
Caitanya was so strict that He at once  rejected him from the society of His
personal associates. Lord Cait anya said, “For a sannyäsé  or anyone who is
aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate
himself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him,
looking toward material possessions and women for sense gra tification—not
even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity—is
so condemned that he had better commi t suicide before experiencing such
illicit desires.” So these are the processes for purification.
The next item is jïäna-yoga-vyavasthiti:  being engaged in the cultivation of
knowledge. Sannyäsé  life is meant for distributing knowledge to the
householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual
advancement. A sannyäsé  is supposed to beg from door to door for his
livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of
the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer
humility the sannyäsé  goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpo se of
begging, but to see the householders an d awaken them to Kåñëa consciousness.
This is the duty of a sannyäsé.  If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his
spiritual master, he should preach Kåñëa consciousness with logic and
understanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the
renounced order of life. But even if one has accepted the renounced order of
life without sufficient knowledge, he sh ould engage himself fully in hearingCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowled ge. A sannyäsé,  or one in
the renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saàçuddhi
(purity) and jïäna-yoga  (knowledge).
The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The
householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty
percent of their income to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world.
Thus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are
engaged in that way. Charity should be  given to the right receiver. There are
different kinds of charity, as will be explained later on—charity in the modes
of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode  of goodness is
recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and
ignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity
should be given only to propagate Kåñë a consciousness all over the world. That
is charity in  the mode of goodness.
Then as far as dama  (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for
other orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder.
Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life
unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life,
which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not
require children, he should not enjoy se x life with his wife. Modern society
enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or m ore abominable methods to
avoid the responsibility of children. This  is not in the transcendental quality,
but is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress
in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child
without the purpose of serving Kåñëa. If he is able to beget children who will
be in Kåñëa consciousness, one can prod uce hundreds of children, but without
this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.
Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because
sacrifices require a large amount of mo ney. Those in other orders of life,
namely brahmacarya, vänaprastha  and sannyäsa,  have no money; they live by
begging. So performance of different  types of sacrifice is meant for the
householders. They should perform agni-hotra  sacrifices as enjoined in the
Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at  the present moment are very expensive,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice
recommended in this age is called saìkértana-yajïa.  This saìkértana-yajïa,  the
chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,
Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive
sacrifice; everyone can a dopt it and derive benefi t. So these three items,
namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the
householder.
Then svädhyäya,  Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya,  or student life.
Brahmacärés  should have no connection with wo men; they should live a life of
celibacy and engage the mind in the stud y of Vedic literature for cultivation of
spiritual knowledge. This is called svädhyäya.
Tapas, or austerity, is especially me ant for the retired life. One should not
remain a householder throughout his whol e life; he must always remember that
there are four divisions of life— brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha  and
sannyäsa.  So after gåhastha,  householder life, one should retire. If one lives for
a hundred years, he should spend twenty -five years in student life, twenty-five
in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the
renounced order of life. These are the regulations  of the Vedic religious
discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the
body, mind and tongue. That is tapasya.  The entire varëäçrama-dharma  society
is meant for tapasya.  Without tapasya,  or austerity, no human being can get
liberation. The theory that there is no n eed of austerity in life, that one can go
on speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the
Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gétä.  Such theories are manufactured by
show-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are
restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore
those who want followers in the name of  religion, just to have a show only,
don’t restrict the lives of their students, n or their own lives. But that method is
not approved by the Vedas.
As far as the brahminical quality of si mplicity is concerned, not only should
a particular order of life follow this pr inciple, but every member, be he in the
brahmacäré äçrama, gåhastha äçrama, vänaprastha äçrama  or sannyäsa äçrama.
One should be very sim ple and straightforward.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Ahiàsä  means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One
should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the
killing of the body there is no harm in  killing animals for sense gratification.
People are now addicted t o eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply
of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This
injunction is for everyone. When there is no alternative, one may kill an
animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an
ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make
advancement in spiritual realization sh ould not commit violence to animals.
Real ahiàsä  means not checking anyone’s progressive life. The animals are also
making progre ss in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category
of animal life to another. If a particul ar animal is killed, then his progress is
checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so
many years and is untimely kill ed, then he has to come back again in that form
of life to complete the remaining days  in order to be promoted to another
species of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s
palate. This is called ahiàsä.
Satyam.  This word means that one should not distort the truth for some
personal interest. In Vedic literature th ere are some difficult passages, but the
meaning or the purpose should be learne d from a bona fide spiritual master.
That is the process for und erstanding the Vedas.  Çruti  means that one should
hear from the authority. One should no t construe some interpretation for his
personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä  that
misinterpret the original text . The real import of the wo rd should be
presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.
Akrodha  means to check anger. Even if th ere is provocation one should be
tolerant, for once one becomes angry hi s whole body becomes polluted. Anger
is a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally
situated should check himself from anger. Apaiçunam  means that one should
not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a
thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to  call an honest person a thief is very
much offensive for one who is making advancement in sp iritual life. Hré means
t h a t  o n e  s h o u l d  b e  v e r y  m o d e s t  a n d must not perform some act which isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.abominable. Acäpalam,  determination, means that one should not be agitated
or frustrated in some attempt. There ma y be failure in some attempt, but one
should not  be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and
determination.
The word tejas u s e d  h e r e  i s  m e a n t  f o r  t h e  kñatriyas.  The kñatriyas  should
always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should
not pose themselves as nonviolent. If viol ence is required, they must exhibit it.
But a person who is abl e to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions
show forgiveness. He may excuse minor offenses.
Çaucam  means cleanliness, not only in mi nd and body but in one’s dealings
also. It is especially meant for the me rcantile people, who should not deal in
the black market. Näti-mänitä,  not expecting honor, applies to the çüdras,  the
worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the
lowest of the four classes. They sh ould not be puffed up with unnecessary
prestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the
çüdras  to offer respect to the higher class for t he upkeep of the social order.
All these twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities.
They should be cultivated according to  the different statuses of social and
occupational order. The purport is that even though material conditions are
miserable, if these qualitie s are developed by practice, by all classes of men,
then gradually it is possible to rise to  the highest platform of transcendental
realization.

Pride, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness and ignorance—these qualities

PURPORT
In this verse, the royal road to he ll is described. The demoniac want to
make a show of religion and advancemen t in spiritual science, although they
do not follow the principles. They are always arrogant or proud in possessing
some type of education or so much wealth. They desire to be worshiped by
others, and demand respectability, al though they do not command respect.
Over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly, not gently. They do
n o t  k n o w  w h a t  s h o u l d  b e  d o n e  a n d  what should not be done. They d o
everything whimsically, according to their own desire, and they do not
recognize any authority. These demoniac  qualities are taken on by them from
the beginning of their bodies in the wo mbs of their mothers, and as they grow
they manifest all these inaus picious qualities.

PURPORT
Lord Kåñëa encouraged Arjuna by te lling him that he was not born with
demoniac qualities. His involvement in  the fight was not demoniac, because he
was considering the pros and cons. He was considering whether respectable
persons such as Bhéñma and Droëa s hould be killed or not, so he was not acting
under the influence of anger, false prestige or harshness. Therefore he was not
of the quality of the demons. For a kñatriya,  a military man, shooting arrows at
the enemy is considered transcendental, and refrai ning from such a duty is
demoniac. Therefore there was no caus e for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who
performs the regulative principles of the different orders of life is
transcendentally situated.

are divided into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine
qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in
scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of
authoritative scripture. This mentalit y is called divine. One who does not
follow the regulative principles as they are laid down i n the scriptures and who
acts according to his whims is called de moniac or asuric. There is no other
criterion but obedience to the regulati ve principles of scriptures. It is
mentioned in Vedic literature that bo th the demigods and the demons are
born of t he Prajäpati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic
injunctions and the other does not.

TRANSLATION
Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to
be done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.
PURPORT
In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and
regulations which is followed from the beginning. Especially among the
Äryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most
advanced civilized peoples, those  who do not follow the scriptural injunctions
are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is  stated here that the demons do not
know the scriptural rules, nor do they  have any inclination to follow them.
Most of them do not know them , and even if some of them know, they have
not the tendency to follow them. They ha ve no faith, nor are they willing to
act in terms of the Vedic injunction s. The demons are not clean, either
externally or internally. One should always be careful to keep his body cleanCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.by bathing, b rushing teeth, shaving, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal
cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God
and chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,
Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. The demons ne ither like nor follow all
these rules for external and internal cleanliness.
As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human
behavior, such as the Manu-saàhitä,  which is the law of the human race. Even
up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-saàhitä.  Laws of
inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the
Manu-saàhitä  it is clearly stated that a wo man should not be given freedom.
That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like
children. Children are not given freedom , but that does not mean that they
are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they
think that women should be given as mu ch freedom as men. However, this has
not improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be
given protection at every stage  of life. She should be given protection by the
father in her younger days, by the husb and in her youth, and by the grownup
sons in her old age. This is proper  social behavior according to the
Manu-saàhitä.  But modern education has artificially devised a p uffed-up
concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an
imagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of woman very good
now. The demons, therefore, do not acce pt any instruction which is good for
society, and because they  do not follow the experience of great sages and the
rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the
demoniac people is very miserable.

TRANSLATION
They say that this world is unreal, with no foundation, no God in control.
They say it is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust.
PURPORT
The demonic conclude that the world is  phantasmagoria. There is no cause
and effect, no controller, no purpose: ev erything is unreal. They say that this
cosmic manifestation arises due to chan ce material actions and reactions. They
do not think that the wo rld was created by God for a certain purpose. They
have their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that
there is no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no
difference between spirit and matter, and they  do not accept the Supreme
Spirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a
mass of ignorance. According to them , everything is void, and whatever
manifestation exists is due to our igno rance in perception. They take it for
grant ed that all manifestation of diversity is  a display of ignorance. Just as in a
dream we may create so many things which actually have no existence, so
when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But
factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in
enjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become
more and more implicated in their dreaml and. They conclude that as a child is
simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and wom an, this world isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has
produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the
soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead
body with out any cause, the whole living world has come out of the material
combinations of the cosmic manifestation. Therefore material nature is the
cause of this manifestation, and there is  no other cause. They do not believe in
the words of Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gé tä: mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate
sa-caräcaram.  “Under My direction the whole material world is moving.” In
other words, among the demons there is  no perfect knowledge of the creation
of the world; every one of them has some particular theory of his own.
According to them, one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as another,
for they do not believe in a standa rd understanding of the scriptural
injunctions.

Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to
destroy the world.
PURPORT
The demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to
destruction. The Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The
materialists, who have no concept of Go d, think that they are advancing. But
according to Bhagavad-gétä,  they are unint elligent and devoid of all sense.
They try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always
engage in inventing something for sens e gratification. Such materialistic
inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization, bu t the
result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel,
cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings. They have no idea how to
behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst
demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because
ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to
all. Indirectly, this verse anticipate s the invention of nuclear weapons, of
which the whole world is today very proud. At any momen t war may take
place, and these atomic weapons may cr eate havoc. Such things are created
solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to
godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant
for the peace a nd prosperity of the world.

Taking shelter of insatiable lust and absorbed in the conceit of pride and
false prestige, the demoniac, thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work,
attracted by the impermanent.
PURPORT
The demoniac mentality is described here. The demons have no satiation
for their lust. They will go on increasing  and increasing their insatiable desires
for material enjoyment. Although they are always full of anxieties on account
of accepting nonpermanen t things, they still continue to engage in such
activities out of illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are
heading the wrong way. Accepting no npermanent things, such demoniac
people create their own God, create their own hymns and cha nt accordingly.
T h e  r e s u l t  i s  t h a t  t h e y  b e c o m e  m o r e  and more attracted to two things—sex
enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth. The word açuci-vratäù,
“unclean vows,” is very significant in  this connection. Such demoniac people
are only attracted b y wine, women, gambling and meat-eating; those are their
açuci,  unclean habits. Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some
principles of religion which are no t approved by the Vedic injunctions.
Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, by artificial
means the world creates a false honor for them. Although they are gliding
toward hell, they consider themselves very much advanced.

They believe that to gratify the sens es is the prime necessity of human

a network of hundreds of thousands of desires and absorbed in lust and anger,
they secure money by ille gal means for sense gratification.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT
The demoniac accept that the enjoymen t of the senses is the ultimate goal
of life, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not believe in life
after death, and they do not believe that  one takes on different types of bodies
according to one’s karma,  or activities in this world. Their plans for life are
never finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never
finished. We have personal experience of  a person of such demoniac mentality
who, even at the point of death, was r equesting the physician to prolong his
life for four years more because his pl ans were not yet complete. Such foolish
people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment.
When the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man’ s desire. The
laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy.
The demoniac person, who has no f aith in God or the Supersoul within
himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He
does not know that there is a witness si tting within his heart. The Supersoul is
observing the activiti es of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Upaniñads,
there are two birds sitting in one tree; one is acting and enjoying or suffering
the fruits of the branches, and the other is witnessing. But one who is
demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scriptu re, nor has he any faith; therefore
he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the
consequences.

Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions,

PURPORT
The demoniac man knows no limit to hi s desire to acquire money. That is
unlimited. He thinks only of how much assessment he has just now and
schemes to engage that stock of wealth  further and further. For that reason, heCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.does not hesitate to act in any sin ful way and so deals in the black market for
illegal gratification. He is enamored by  the possessions he has already, such as
land, family, house and bank balance, an d he is always planning to improve
them. He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he
is gaining is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to
accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply
thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac
person believ es in the strength of his pers onal work, not in the law of karma.
According to the law of karma,  a man takes his birth in a high family, or
becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in
the past. The demoniac think that all  these things are accidental and due to
the strength of one’s personal abilit y. They do not sense any arrangement
behind all the varieties of people, beauty and education. Anyone who comes
into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are m any
demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more
and more deep—between persons, th en between families, then between
societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war
and enmity all over the world.
Each demoniac person thinks that he ca n live at the sacrifice of all others.
Generally, a demoniac person thinks of  himself as the Supreme God, and a
demoniac preacher tells his followers: “Why are you seeking God elsewhere?
You are all yourselves God! Wha tever you like, you can do. Don’t believe in
God. Throw away God. God is dead.” These are the demoniac’s preachings.
Although the demoniac person sees ot hers equally rich and influential, or
even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than he and that no one is more
influential than he. As far as promot ion to the higher planetary system is
concerned, he does not believ e in performing yajïas,  or sacrifices. Demons
think that they will manufacture their own process of yajïa  and prepare some
machine by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best
example of such a demoniac man was Rävaëa. He offered a progr am to the
people by which he would prepare a stair case so that anyone could reach the
heavenly planets without performing sacr ifices, such as are prescribed in the
Vedas.  Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reachCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the higher plan etary systems by mechanical arrangements. These are examples
of bewilderment. The result is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding
toward hell. Here the Sanskrit word moha-jäla  is very significant. Jäla means
“net”; like fish caught in a net, they  have no way to come out.

of spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and
engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actu ally there are so many restrictions for
one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such
restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one’s own path;
there is no such thin g as a standard path one has to follow. The word
avidhi-pürvakam,  meaning a disregard for the rules and regulations, is
especially stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion.

bodies and in the bodies of others, and blaspheme against the real religion.
PURPORT
A demoniac person, being always against  God’s supremacy, does not like to
believe in the scriptures. He is envious of both the scriptures and the existence
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-called prestige
and his accumulation  of wealth and strength. He does not know that the
present life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is actually
envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on other
bodies and on his own. He does not care for the  supreme control of the
Personality of Godhead, because he ha s no knowledge. Being envious of the
scriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false
arguments against the existence of God an d denies the scriptural authority. He
thinks  himself independent and powerful in every action. He thinks that since
no one can equal him in strength, power or wealth, he can act in any way and
no one can stop him. If he has an enemy who might check the advancement of
his sensual activities, he makes  plans to cut him down by his own power.

TRANSLATION
Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I
perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac
species of life.
PURPORT
In this verse it is clearly indicated that the placing of a particular individual
soul in a particular body is the prer ogative of the supreme will. The demoniac
person may not agree to accept the suprem acy of the Lord, and it is a fact that
he may act acco rding to his own whims, but hi s next birth will depend upon
the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  Third Canto , it is stated that an individual soul, after his
death, is put into the womb of a mothe r where he gets a particular type of body
under the supervision of superior power. Therefore in the material existence
we find so many species of life—anima ls, insects, men, and so on. All are
arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for  the demoniac,
it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs of demons,
and thus they continue to be envious,  the lowest of mankind. Such demoniac
species of men are held to be always fu ll of lust, always violent and hateful and
alwa ys unclean. The many kinds of hunters in the jungle are considered to
belong to the demoniac species of life.

TRANSLATION
Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, O son of
Kunté, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the
most abominable type of existence.
PURPORT
It is known that God is all-merciful, but here we find that God is never
merciful to the demoniac. It is clearl y stated that the demoniac people, life
after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the
mercy of the Supreme Lord, t hey go down and down, so that at last they
achieve bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such
demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage
of later life. In the Vedas  also it is stated that such  persons gradually sink to
become dogs and hogs. It may be then  argued in this connection that God
should not be advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons.
In answer to this question, in the Vedänta-sütra  we find that the Supreme Lord
has no hatred for anyone. The placing of the asuras,  the demons, in the lowest
status of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras  are
killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killi ng is also good for them, for in Vedic
literature we f ind that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes
liberated. There are instances in history of many asuras —Rävaëa, Kaàsa,
Hiraëyakaçipu—to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just toCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.kill them. Therefore God’s mercy is shown to the asura s if they are fortunate
enough to be killed by Him.

PURPORT
One should be very careful of these th ree enemies to human life: lust, anger
and greed. The more a person is freed from lust, anger and greed, the more his
existence becomes pure. Then he can fo llow the rules and regulations enjoined
in the Vedic literatur e. By following the regulative principles of human life,
one gradually raises himself to the platform  of spiritual realization. If one is so
fortunate, by such practice, to rise to the platform of Kåñëa consciousness,
then success is guaranteed for him. In  the Vedic literature, the ways of action
and reaction are prescribed to enable on e to come to the stage of purification.
The whole method is based on giving up  lust, greed and anger. By cultivating
knowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the hig hest position ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.self-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service. In that
devotional service, the liberation of  the conditioned soul is guaranteed.
Therefore, according to the Vedic system , there are instituted the four orders
of life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual
order system. There are different rules and regulations for different castes or
divisions of society, and if a person is able to follow them, he will be
automatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization. Then he
can have liberation without a doubt.

He who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims
attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination.
PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.As described before, the çästra-vidhi,  or the direction of the çästra,  is given
to the different castes and orders of human society. Everyone is expected to
follow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow them and acts
whimsically according to h is lust, greed and desire, then he never will be
perfect in his life. In other words, a man may theoretically know all these
things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as
the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to
be sane and to follow the regulations give n for elevating his life to the highest
platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But even if
he follows the rules and regulati ons and moral principles and u ltimately does
not come to the stage of understand ing the Supreme Lord, then all his
knowledge becomes spoiled. And even if he accepts the existence of God, if he
does not engage himself in the service of the Lord his attempts are spoiled.
Therefore one sh ould gradually raise himself to the platform of Kåñëa
consciousness and devotional service; it  is then and there that he can attain
the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise.
The word käma-kärataù  is very significant. A person who knowingly
violates the rules acts in lust. He knows th at this is forbidden, but still he acts.
This is called acting whimsically. He know s that this should be done, but still
he does not do it; theref ore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to
be condemned by the Supreme Lord. Su ch persons cannot have the perfection
which is meant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for
purifying one’s existence, and one who does not fol low the rules and
regulations cannot purify himself, nor can he attain the real stage of
happiness.

TRANSLATION
One should therefore understand what is duty and what is not duty by the
regulations of the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should
act so that he may gradually be elevated.
PURPORT
As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter , all the rules and regulations of the
Vedas  are meant for knowing Kåñëa. If  one understands Kåñëa from the
Bhagavad-gétä  and becomes situated in Kåñëa consciousness, engaging himself
in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge
offered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu made this process
very easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa
Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare and to
engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff
offered to the Deity. One who is dire ctly engaged in all these devotional
activities is to be understood as havi ng studied all Vedic literature. He has
come to the conclusion perfe ctly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are
not in Kåñëa consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what
is to be done and what is not to be do ne must be decided by the injunctions of
the Vedas.  One should act accordingly, without ar gument. That is called
following the principles of çästra,  or scripture. Çästra  is without the fourCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.principal defects that are visible in th e conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the
propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty o f
being illusioned. These four principal defe cts in conditioned life disqualify one
from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations
as described in the çästra —being above these defects—are accepted without
alteration by all g reat saints, äcäryas  and great souls.
In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally
classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however,
lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas.  Without following the
principles of the script ures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional
stage. One who actually, therefore,  understands the purport of the çästras  is
considered fortunate.
In human society, aversion to the pr inciples of understanding the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the cause of  all falldowns. That is the greatest
offense of human life. Therefore, mäyä,  the material energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is alway s giving us trouble in the shape of the
threefold miseries. This material energy  is constituted of the three modes of
material nature. One has to raise hims elf at least to the mode of goodness
before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened . Without
raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in
ignorance and passion, which are the ca use of demoniac life. Those in the
modes of passion and ignorance deride th e scriptures, deride the holy man, and
deride the proper und erstanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They
disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the
regulations of the scriptures. In spit e of hearing the glories of devotional
service, they are not attracted. Thus they ma nufacture their own way of
elevation. These are some of the defect s of human society which lead to the
demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and
bona fide spiritual master, who can lead  one to the path of elevation, to the
higher stage, then one’s life becomes successful.

PURPORT
In the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse , it is said that a person faithful to
a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of
knowledge and attains the highest perfec tional stage of peace and prosperity.
In the Sixteenth Chapter , it is concluded that one who does not follow the
principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura,  demon, and one who
follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva,  or demigod. Now,
if one, with faith, follows some rules which are  not mentioned in the scriptural
injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna’s is to be cleared by
Kåñëa. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and
placing their faith in him worshiping  in goodness, passion or ignoran ce? Do
such persons attain the perfectional stag e of life? Is it possible for them to be
situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional
stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures
but who hav e faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men
attain success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to Kåñëa.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead sa id: According to the modes of nature
acquired by the embodied soul, one’s fa ith can be of three kinds—in goodness,
in passion or in ignorance. Now hear about this.
PURPORT
Those who know the rules and regula tions of the scriptures but out of
laziness or indolence give up followi ng these rules and regulations are
governed by the modes of material nature. According to their previous
activities in the mode of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature
which is of a specific quality. The association of the living entity with the
different modes of nature has been goin g on perpetually; since the living entity
is in contact with material nature, he acquires different typ es of mentality
according to his association with the ma terial modes. But this nature can be
changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his
rules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from
ignorance to go odness, or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that
blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become
elevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with
intelligence, in the association of a bona fid e spiritual master. Thus one can
change his position to a higher mode of nature.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  3

TRANSLATION
O son of Bharata, according to one’s existence under the various modes of
nature, one evolves a particular kind of fa ith. The living being is said to be of a
particular faith according to the modes he has acquired.
PURPORT
Everyone has a particular type of fait h, regardless of what he is. But his
faith is considered good, passionate or ig norant according to the nature he has
acquired. Thus, according to his particul ar type of faith, one associates with
certain persons. Now t he real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the
Fifteenth Chapter , is originally a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme
Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material
nature. But when one forgets his relatio nship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.he generates his own position by asso ciation with the different varieties of
material nature. The resultant ar tificial faith and existence ar e only material.
Although one may be conducted by some  impression, or some conception of
life, originally he is nirguëa,  or transcendental. Therefore one has to become
cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired, in order to regain
his rela tionship with the Supreme Lord. That  is the only path back without
fear: Kåñëa consciousness. If one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness, then that
path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not
take to this path of self-rea lization, then he is surely to be conducted by the
influence of the modes of nature.
The word çraddhä,  or “faith,” is very significant in this verse. Çraddhä,  or
faith, originally comes out of the mode  of goodness. One’s faith may be in a
demigod or some created God or some me ntal concoction. One’s strong faith is
supposed to be productive  of works of material goodness. But in material
conditional life, no works are completely  purified. They are mixed. They are
not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is  transcendental; in purified goodness
one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Perso nality of Godhead.
As long as one’s faith is not complete ly in purified goodness, the faith is
subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The
contaminated modes of material natu re expand to the heart. Therefore
according to the positi on of the heart in contact with a particular mode of
material nature, one’s faith is established.  It should be understood that if one’s
heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his
heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if
his heart is in the mode of darkne ss, illusion, his faith is also thus
contaminated. Thus we find different ty pes of faith in this world, and there
are different types of religions due to different types of fait h. The real
principle of religious faith is situated  i n  t h e  m o d e  o f  p u r e  g o o d n e s s ,  b u t
because the heart is tainted we find diffe rent types of religious principles. Thus
according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.

Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of

PURPORT
In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds
of worshipers according to their extern al activities. According to scriptural
injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those
who are not very conversa nt with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions
worship different objects, according to th eir specific situations in the modes of
material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the
demigods. The demigods include Brahmä, Çiva and others such as Indra,
Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness
worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are
in the mode of passion worship the de mons. We recall that during the SecondCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.World Wa r a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitl er because thanks to that war he
had amassed a large amount of wealth  by dealing in the black market.
Similarly, those in the modes of passi on and ignorance generally select a
powerful man to be God. They think that anyone  can be worshiped as God
and that the same results will be obtained.
Now, it is clearly described here that  those who are in the mode of passion
worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in
darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometime s people worship at the tomb of some
dead man. Sexual service i s  a l s o  c o n s i d e r e d  t o  b e  i n  t h e  m o d e  o f  d a r k n e s s .
Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have
seen that in India the lower-class people  sometimes go to the forest, and if they
have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, t hey worship that tree and offer
sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God
worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In
the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (4.3.23 ) it is said, sattvaà viçuddhaà
vasude va-çabditam:  “When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships
Väsudeva.” The purport is that those who are completely purified of the
material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The impersonalists are supposed to be si tuated in the mode of goodness, and
they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Viñëu form
in the material world, which is known as philosophized Viñëu. Viñëu is the
expansion of the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead, but the impersonalists,
because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
imagine that the Viñëu form is just an other aspect of the impersonal Brahman;
similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahmä is the imperson al form in the
material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that
are worshipable, but because they thin k that the actual truth is impersonal
Brahman, they dispose of all worshipa ble objects at the ultimate end. In
conclusion, t he different qualities of the material modes of nature can be
purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature.

TRANSLATION
Those who undergo severe austerities an d penances not recommended in the
scriptures, performing them out of pride and egoism, who are impelled by lust
and attachment, who are foolish and who torture the material elements of the
body as well as the Supersou l dwelling within, are to be known as demons.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT
There are persons who manufacture mo des of austerity and penance which
are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some
ulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in
the scriptural direction s. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual
advancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to
such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-gétä,  certainly demoniac. Their acts
are against the scriptural injunctions and are  not beneficial for the people in
general. Actually, they act out of prid e, false ego, lust and attachment for
material enjoyment. By such activities, not only is the combination of material
elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the  Supreme
Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized
fasting or austerities for some politica l end are certainly very disturbing to
others. They are not mentioned in th e Vedic literature. A demoniac person
may think that he can  force his enemy or other parties to comply with his
desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are
not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those
who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations  are insults to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to
the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasaù  is significant in this
connection. Persons of normal mental  condition must obey the scriptural
injunctions. T hose who are not in such a po sition neglect and disobey the
scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One
should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described
in the previous chapter . The Lord forces them  to take birth in the wombs of
demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life
after life without knowing their relati onship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a
spiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic wisdom, they can get
out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  7

TRANSLATIONCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Food prepared more than three hours before being eaten, food that is
tasteless, decomposed and putrid, and food consisting of remnants and
untouchable things is dear to those in the mode of darkness.
PURPORT
The purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and
aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities
selected those foods that best aid health  and increase life’s duration, such as
milk products, sugar,  rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very
dear to those in the mode of goodness.  Some other foods, such as baked corn
and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant
when mixed with milk or other foods. They are t hen in the mode of goodness.
All these foods are pure by nature. They  are quite distinct from untouchable
things like meat and liquor. Fa tty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse , have
no connection with animal fat obtain ed by slaughter. Animal fat is av ailable in
the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese
and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the
killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this
killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk.
Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Pr otein is amply available through split
peas, däl, whole wheat, etc.
Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or
overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by reducing the mucus in the
stomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are
essentially those that are not fres h. Any food cooked more than three hours
before it is eaten (except prasädam,  food offered to the Lord) is considered to
be in the mode of darkness. Because th ey are decomposing, such foods give a
bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repu lses those in the
mode of goodness.
Remnants of food may be eaten only wh en they are part of a meal that was
first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially
the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnan ts of food are considered to be inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs,
although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked
nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the
remnants of what is offered to the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead. In
Bhagavad-gétä  the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of
vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patraà puñpaà phalaà
toyam.  Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme
Personality of Godhe ad accepts. But it is also mentioned that the prasädam
should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunctions
of the scripture and offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be
taken even if prepared long, long ago, because suc h food is transcendental.
Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one
should offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
The general tendency is to offer sacrifice with some purpose in mind, but
here it is stated that sacrifice should  be performed without any such desire. It
should be done as a matter of duty. Take, for example, the performance of
rituals in temples or in ch urches. Generally they are performed with the
purpose of material benefit, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One
should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer flowers and eatables.  Everyone
thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship God. But
worship for economic benefit is not recommended in the scriptural
injunctions. One should go simply to offer respect to the Deity. That will place
one in the mode of good ness. It is the duty of every civilized man to obey the
injunctions of the scriptures and offe r respect to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

mother or any person who is conversant with Vedic knowledge. These should
be given proper respect. One should pr actice cleansing oneself externally and
internally, and he should learn to become simple in b ehavior. He should not do
anything which is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunctions. He should not
indulge in sex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture only
in marriage, not otherwise. This is called celibacy. These are penan ces and

One should not speak in such a way as  to agitate the minds of others. Of
course, when a teacher speaks, he can sp eak the truth for the instruction of his
students, but such a teacher should not speak to those who are not his students
if he will agitate the ir minds. This is penance as far as talking is concerned.
Besides that, one should not talk nonsense . The process of speaking in spiritual
circles is to say something upheld by the scriptures. One should at once quote
from scriptural authority to back up w hat he is saying. At the same time, such
talk should be very pleasurable to the ear. By such discussions, one may derive
the highest benefit and elevate human so ciety. There is a limitless stock of
Vedic literature, and one should study this. This is calle d penance of speech.

TRANSLATION
And satisfaction, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purification of one’s
existence are the austerities of the mind.
PURPORT
To make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It should
be so trained that it can be always th inking of doing good for others. The best
training for the mind is gravity in thou ght. One should not deviate from Kåñëa
consciousness and mu st always avoid sense gratific ation. To purify one’s nature
is to become Kåñëa conscious. Satisfacti on of the mind can be obtained only by
taking the mind away from thoughts of  sense enjoyment. The more we think
of sense enjoyment, the more the mind become s dissatisfied. In the present age
we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense
gratification, and so there is no possibi lity of the mind’s becoming satisfied.
The best course is to divert the mi nd to the Vedic literature, which is full of
satisfying stories, as in the Puräëas  and the Mahäbhärata.  One can take
advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be
devoid of duplicity, and one should thin k of the welfare of all. Silence means
that one is always think ing of self-realization. The person in Kåñëa
consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind
means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be
straightforward in his dealings and thereby purify his existence. All these
qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities.

solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified brähmaëa  or a
Vaiñëava (devotee) or in temples. Such  charities should be given without any
consideration of return. Charity to the poor is sometimes given out of
compassion, but if a poor man is not wo rth giving charity to, then there is no
spiritual advancement. In other words, indiscriminate charity is not
recommended in the Vedic literature.

But charity performed with the expectation of some return, or with a desire
for fruitive results, or in a grudging mood, is said to be charity in the mode of
passion.
PURPORT
Charity is sometimes performed for elevation to the heavenly kingdom and
sometimes with great trouble and with repentance afterwards: “Why have I
spent so much in this way?” Charit y is also sometimes given under some
obligation, at the request of a superio r. These kinds of charity are said to be
given in the mode of passion.
There are many charitable foundations which offer their gifts to
institutions where sense gratificatio n goes on. Such charities are not
recommended in the Vedic scripture. On ly charity in the mode of goodness is
recommended.

From the beginning of creation, the three words oà tat sat were used to
indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth. These three symbolic representations
were used by brähmaëas while chantin g the hymns of the Vedas and during
sacrifices for the satisfaction of the  Supreme.
PURPORT
It has been explained that penance, sa crifice, charity and foods are divided
into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But
whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned,
contaminated by the material m odes of nature. When they are aimed at the
Supreme— oà tat sat,  the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal—they
become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an
objective is indicated. These three words, oà tat sat,  particula rly indicate the
Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the
word oà is always found.
One who acts without following the re gulations of the scriptures will not
attain the Absolute Truth. He will ge t some temporary result, but not the
ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charity,
sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the
mode of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three
words oà tat sat  are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme
Lord, e.g., oà tad viñëoù.  Whenever a Vedic hymn or the h o l y  n a m e  o f  t h e
Supreme Lord is uttered, oà is added. This is the indication of Vedic
literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. Oà ity etad
brahmaëo nediñöhaà näma  (Åg Veda ) indicates the first goal. Then tat tvam asi
(Chändogya Upaniñad  6.8.7) indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya
(Chändogya Upaniñad  6.2.1) indicates the third goal. Combined they become
oà tat sat.  Formerly when Brahmä, the first created living entity, performed
sacrifices, he indicated by these three words the Sup reme Personality of
Godhead. Therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplicCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-gétä  recommends,
therefore, that any work done should be done for oà tat sat,  or for the
Supreme Perso nality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity and
sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa
consciousness is a scientific executio n of transcendental activities which
enables one to return home, back to Godhead. T h ere is no loss of energy in
acting in such a transcendental way.

TRANSLATION
The Absolute Truth is the objective of devotional sacrifice, and it is
indicated by the word sat. The performer of such sacrifice is also called sat, as
are all works of sacrifice, penance and charity which, true to the absoluteCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.nature, are performed to pl ease the Supreme Person, O son of Påthä.
PURPORT
The words praçaste karmaëi,  or “prescribed duties,” indicate that there are
many activities prescribed in the Vedic literature which are purificatory
processes, beginning from the time of co nception up to the end of one’s life.
Such purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the
living entity. In all such activities  it is recommended that one vibrate oà tat
sat. The words sad-bhäve  and sädhu-bhäve  indicate the transcendental
situation. Acting in Kåñëa consciousness is called sattva,  and one who is fully
conscious of the activities of Kåñëa consciousness is called a sädhu.  In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.25.25 ) it is said that the transcendental subject matter
becomes clear in the association of the devotees. The words used are satäà
prasaì gät. Without good association, on e cannot achieve transcendental
knowledge. When initiating a person or offering the sacred thread, one
vibrates the words oà tat sat.  Similarly, in all kinds of performance of yajïa
the object is the Supreme, oà tat sat.  The word tad-arthéyam  further means
offering service to anything which represents the Supreme, including such
service as cooking and helping in the Lo rd’s temple, or any other kind of work
for broadcasting the glories of the Lord. These supreme words oà tat sat are
thus used in many ways to perfect all activities and make everything complete.

TRANSLATION
Anything done as sacrifice, charity or penance without faith in the Supreme,
O son of Påthä, is impermanent. It is ca lled asat and is useless both in this life
and the next.
PURPORT
Anything done without the transc endental objective—whether it be
sacrifice, charity or penance—is useless. Therefore in this verse it is declared
that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the
Supreme in Kåñëa consciousness. Without  such faith, and without the proper
guidance, there can never be any fruit. In  all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the
Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of a ll Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is
the understanding of Kåñëa. No one can obtain success w ithout following this
principle. Therefore, the best course i s  t o  w o r k  f r o m  t h e  v e r y  b e g i n n i n g  i n
Kåñëa consciousness under the guidance of  a bona fide spiritual master. That is
the way to make everything successful.
In the conditional state, people are attracted to worshiping demigods,
ghosts, or Yakñas like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes
of passion and ignorance, but one who ta kes directly to Kåñëa consciousness is
transcendental to all three m odes of material nature. Although there is a
process of gradual elevation, if one, by  the association of pure devotees, takes
directly to Kåñëa consciousness, that is  the best way. And that is recommended
in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, on e must first find the properCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can
achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is
called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One
should therefore take to Kåñëa consciou sness directly. That is the message of
this Seventeenth Chapter.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventeenth Chapter of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä  in the matter of the Divisions of Faith.

Arjuna said: O mighty-armed one, I wish to understand the purpose of
renunciation [tyäga] and of the renounce d order of life [sannyäsa], O killer of
the Keçé demon, master of the senses.
PURPORT
Actually the Bhagavad-gétä  is finished in seventeen chapters. The
Eighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed
before. In every chapter of Bhagavad-gétä,  Lord Kåñëa stresses that devotional
service unto the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life.
This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most
confidential path of knowledge. In th e first six chapters, stress was given to
devotional service: yoginäm api sarveñäà . .. “Of all yogés  or tran scendentalists,
one who always thinks of Me within hims elf is best.” In the next six chapters,
pure devotional service and its nature an d activity were discussed. In the third
six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and
transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was
concluded that all acts should be perf ormed in conjunction with the Supreme
Lord, represented by the words oà tat sat,  which indicate Viñëu, the Supreme
Person. The third part of Bhagavad-gé tä has shown that devotional service, and
nothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing
past äcäryas  and the Brahma-sütra,  the Vedänta-sütra.  Certain impersonalists
consider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledg e of Vedänta-sütra,
but actually the Vedänta-sütra  is meant for understanding devotional service,
for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Vedänta-sütra  and He is its
knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter . In every scripture, every
Veda,  devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-gétä.
As in the Second Chapter  a synopsis of the whole subject matter was
described, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.given. The purpose of life is indicate d to be renunciation and attainment of
the transcendental position above t he three material modes of nature. Arjuna
wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-gétä,  namely
renunciation ( tyäga ) and the renounced order of life ( sannyäsa ) .  T h u s  h e  i s
asking the meaning of these two words.
Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord—Håñékeça and
Keçé-niñüdana—are significant. Håñékeça is Kåñëa, the master of all senses, who
can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize
everything in such a way that he can remain equipoised. Yet he has some
doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses
Kåñëa as Keçé-niñüdana. Keçé was a most formidable demon who was killed by
the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting Kåñëa to kill the demon of doubt .

PURPORT
The performance of activities for results has to be given up. This is the
instruction of Bhagavad-gétä.  But activities leading to advanced spiritual
knowledge are not to be given up. This wi ll be made clear in the next verses. In
the Vedic literature there  are many prescriptions of methods for performing
sacrifice for some particular purpose. Th ere are certain sacrifices to perform to
attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but sacrifices
prompted by desires should be stopped. Howeve r, sacrifice for the purification
of one’s heart or for advancement in th e spiritual science should not be given
up.

TRANSLATION
Some learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activities should be given
up as faulty, yet other sages maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity and penance
should never be abandoned.
PURPORT
There are many activities in the Vedic literature which are subjects of
contention. For instance, it is said that  an animal can be killed in a sacrifice,
yet some maintain that animal killing  is completely abominable. Although
animal killing in a sacrifice  is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal
is not considered to be killed. The sacrif ice is to give a new life to the animal.
Sometimes the animal is given a new an imal life after being killed in the
sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted  immediately to the human
form of life. But there are different op inions among the sages. Some say that
animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific
sacrifice it is good. All these different  opinions on sacrificial activity a re now
being clarified by the Lord Himself.

Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up; they must be

PURPORT
The yogés  should perform acts for the adva ncement of human society. There
are many purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life.
The marriage ceremony, for example, is  considered to be one of these
sacrifices. It is called viväha-ya jïa. Should a sannyäsé,  who is in the renounced
order of life and who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage
ceremony? The Lord says here that an y sacrifice which is meant for human
welfare should never be given up. Viväha-yajïa,  the mar riage ceremony, is
meant to regulate the human mind so that  it may become peaceful for spiritual
advancement. For most men, this viväha-yajïa  should be encouraged even by
persons in the renounced order of life. Sannyäsés  should never associate with
women, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life, a
young man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony. All prescribed
sacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower
stages, they should not be given  up. Similarly, charity is for the purification of
the heart. If charity is given to suitab le persons, as described previously, it
leads one to advanced spiritual life.

PURPORT
Although all sacrifices are purifying,  one should not expect any result by
such performances. In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material
advancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one’s
existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped.
Everything that leads to Kåñëa consci ousness must be encouraged. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also it is said that any ac tivity which leads to devotional
service to the Lord should be a ccepted. That is the highest cri terion of
religion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of work, sacrifice or
charity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Prescribed duties should never be renounced. If one gives up his prescribed
duties because of illusion, such renunciation is said to be in the mode of
ignorance.
PURPORT
Work for material satisfaction must be given up, but activities which
promote one to spiritual activity, li ke cooking for the Supreme Lord and
offering the food to the Lord and th en accepting the food, are recommended.
It is said that a person in the renou nced order of life should not cook for
himself. Cooking for oneself is prohibit ed, but cooking for the Supreme Lord is
not prohibited. Similarly, a sannyäsé  may perform a marriage ceremony to help
his disciple in the advancement of Kåñëa consciousness. If one renounces such
activities, it is to be understood that he is acting in the mode of darkness.

TRANSLATION
Anyone who gives up prescribed duties as troublesome or out of fear of
bodily discomfort is said to have renounced in the mode of passion. Such action
never leads to the elevation of renunciation.
PURPORT
One who is in Kåñëa consciousness shou ld not give up earning money out of
fear that he is performing fruitive acti vities. If by working one can engage his
money in Kåñëa consciousness, or if by  rising early in the morning one can
advance his transcendental  Kåñëa consciousness, one should not desist out of
fear or because such activities are considered troublesome. Such renunciation
is in the mode of passion. The result of passionate work is always miserable. If a
person renounces work in that spirit, he nev er gets the result of renunciation.

O Arjuna, when one performs his pres cribed duty only because it ought to
be done, and renounces all material association and all attachment to the fruit,
his renunciation is said to be in the mode of goodness.
PURPORT
Prescribed duties must be performed with this mentality. One should act
without attachment for the result; he sh ould be disassociated from the modes
of work. A man working in Kåñëa consciousness in a factory does not associate
himself with the work of the factory, nor with the workers of the factory. He
simply works for Kåñëa. And when he gives up the result for Kåñëa, he is acting
transcendentally.

A person in Kåñëa consciousness or in  the mode of goodness does not hate
anyone or anything which troubles his bo dy. He does work in the proper place

Such a person situated in tran scendence should be understood to be most

It is indeed impossible for an embodied being to give up all activities. But he
who renounces the fruits of action is called one who has truly renounced.

It is said in Bhagavad-gétä  t h a t  o n e  c a n  n e v e r  g i v e  u p  w o r k  a t  a n y  t i m e .
Therefore he who works for Kåñëa and does  not enjoy the fruitive results, who
offers everything to Kåñëa, is actua lly a renouncer. There are many members
of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness who work very hard in
their office or in the factory or some other place, and whatever they earn they
give to the Society. Such highly elevated souls are actually sannyäsés  and are
situated in the renounced order of life. It is cl early outlined here how to
renounce the fruits of work and for what purpose fruits should be renounced.

order of life have no such result to suffer or enjoy.

A person in Kåñëa consciousness acti ng in knowledge of his relationship
with Kåñëa is always liberated. Therefore he does not have to enjoy or suffer
the results of his acts after death.

TRANSLATION
O mighty-armed Arjuna, according to the Vedänta there are five causes for
the accomplishment of all action. Now learn of these from Me.
PURPORT
A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some
reaction, how is it that the person in  Kåñëa consciousness does not suffer or
enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Vedänta  philosophy to show
how this is possible. He says  that there are five causes for all activities, and for
success in all activity one should consider these five causes. Säìkhya  means the
stalk of knowledge, and Vedänta  is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by all
leading äcäryas.  Even Çaìkara accepts Vedänta-sütra  as such. Therefore such
authority should be consulted.
The ultimate control is invested in the Supersoul. As it is stated in the
Bhagavad-gétä,  sarvasya cähaà hådi sanniviñöaù . He is engaging everyone in
certain activities by reminding him of his past actions. And Kåñëa conscious
acts done under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life
or in the life after death.

TRANSLATION
The place of action [the body], the performer, the various senses, the many
different kinds of endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul—these are the five
factors of action.
PURPORT
The word adhiñöhänam  refers to the body. The soul within the body is acting
to bring about the results of acti vity and is therefore known as kartä,  “the
doer.” That the soul is the knower  and the doer is stated in the çruti.  Eña hi
drañöä srañöä  (Praçna Up aniñad  4.9). It is also confirmed in the Vedänta-sütra
by the verses jïo ’ta eva  (2.3.18 ) and kartä çästrärthavattvät  (2.3.33 ). The
instruments of action are the senses, and by the senses the soul acts in various
ways. For each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one’s
activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart
as a friend. The Supreme Lord is the supercause. Under these circumstances,
he who is acting in Kåñëa consci ousness under the direction of the Supersoul
situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in
complete Kåñëa consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions.
Everything is dependent on the supr eme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme
Personality of Godhe ad.

The words “right” and “wrong” are very significant in this verse. Right work
is work done in terms of the prescribed  directions in the scriptures, and wrong
work is work done against the principl es of the scriptural injunctions. But
whatever is done requir es these five factors for its complete performance.

Therefore one who thinks himself the only doer, not considering the five
factors, is certainly not very intelligent and cannot see things as they are.

A foolish person cannot understand that  the Supersoul is sitting as a friend
within and conducting his actions. Alth ough the material causes are the place,
the worker, the endeavor and the senses , the final cause is the Supreme, the
Personality of Godhead.  Therefore, one should see not only the four material
causes but the supreme efficient cause as well. One who does not see the
Supreme thinks himself to be the doer.

TRANSLATION
One who is not motivated by false ego, whose intelligence is not entangled,
though he kills men in this world, does not kill. Nor is he bound by his actions.
PURPORT
In this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises
from false ego. Arjuna thought himself to  be the doer of action, but he did not
consider the supreme sanction within and without. If one does not know that a
supersanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the instruments
of work, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the supreme
sanctioner is perfect in doing everything . Such a person is never in illusion.
Personal activity and responsibility arise from false eg o and godlessness, or a
lack of Kåñëa consciousness. Anyone who is acting in Kåñëa consciousness
under the direction of the Supersoul or  the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
even though killing, does not kill. Nor is  he ever affected by the reaction of
such  killing. When a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer, he
is not subject to be judged. But if a so ldier kills on his own personal account,
then he is certainly judged by a court of law.

TRANSLATION
Knowledge, the object of knowledge,  and the knower are the three factors
that motivate action; the senses, the work and the doer are the three
constituents of action.
PURPORT
There are three kinds of impetus for daily work: knowledge, the object of
knowledge, and the knower. The instruments of work, the work itself and the
worker are called the constituents of work. Any work done by any human
being has these elements. Before on e acts, there is some impetus, which is
called inspiration. Any solution arrived at  before work is actualized is a subtle
form of work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the
psychological processes of thinking, feeling and willin g, and that is called
impetus. The inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or
from the instruction of the spiritual ma ster. When the inspiration is there and
the worker is there, then actual acti vity takes place by the help of the se nses,
including the mind, which is the center of all the senses. The sum total of all
the constituents of an activity are called the accumulation of work.

PURPORT
In the Fourteenth Chapter the three divisions of the modes of material
nature were elaborately described. In that chapter it was said that the mode of
goodness  is illuminating, the mode of passion  materialistic, and the mode of
ignorance  conducive to lazin ess and indolence. All the modes of material
nature are binding; they are not source s of liberation. Even in the mode of
goodness one is conditioned. In the Seventeenth Chapter , the different types
of worship by different types of men in different modes of  material nature
were described. In this verse, the Lord says that He wishes to speak about the
different types of knowledge, workers and work itself according to the threeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.material modes.

mode of goodness. In all living entities, one spirit soul is there, although they
have different bodi es in terms of their previous work. As described in the
Seventh Chapter , the manifestation of the living  force in every body is due to
the superior nature of the Supreme Lord. Thus to see that one superior nature,
that living force, in every body is to see  in the mode of goodness. That livingCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.energy is imperishable, although the bodies are perishable. Differences are
perceived in terms of the body; because there are many forms of material

PURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.The “knowledge” of the common man is always in the mode of darkness or
ignorance because every living entity in conditional life is born into the mode
of ignorance. One who does not develop knowledge through the authorities or
scriptural injunctions has kn owledge that is limited to the body. He is not
concerned about acting in terms of the directions of scripture. For him God is
money, and knowledge means the satisfaction of bodily demands. Such
knowledge has no connection with the Absolute Truth. It is mor e or less like
the knowledge of the ordinary animals: the knowledge of eating, sleeping,
defending and mating. Such knowledge is described here as the product of the
mode of darkness. In other words, kno wledge concerning the spirit soul beyond
this body is  called knowledge in the mode of goodness, knowledge producing
many theories and doctrines by dint of  mundane logic and mental speculation
is the product of the mode of passi on, and knowledge concerned only with
keeping the body comfortable is said to be i n the mode of ignorance.

Intelligence in the mode of ignorance is always working the opposite of the
way it should. It accepts religions whic h are not actually religions and rejects
actual religion. Men in ignorance understand a great soul to be a common man
and accept a common ma n as a great soul. They thin k truth to be untruth and
accept untruth as truth. In all activi ties they simply take the wrong path;
therefore their intelligence is in the mode of ignorance.

of determination is in the mod e of goodness. The word avyabhicäriëyä  is very

A conditioned soul tries to enjoy material happiness again and again. Thus
he chews the chewed. But sometimes, in  the course of such enjoyment, he

A young man and a young woman meet , and the senses drive the young
man to see her, to touch her and to have sexual intercourse. In the beginning
this may be very pleasing to the senses , but at the end, or after some time, it
becomes just like poison. They are separated or there is divorce, there is

By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is
all-pervading, a man can attain perfection through performing his own work.
PURPORT
As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, a ll living beings are fragmental parts
and parcels of the Supreme Lord. Thus the Supreme Lord is the beginning of
all living entities. This is confirmed in the Vedänta-sütra —janmädy asya yataù
[SB 1.1.1]. The Supreme Lor d is therefore the beginning of life of every living
entity. And as stated in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä,  the Supreme
Lord, by His two energies, His extern al energy and internal energy, is
all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme L ord with His
energies. Generally the Vaiñëava devot ees worship the Supreme Lord with His
internal energy. His external energy is  a perverted reflection of the internal
energy. The external energy is a back ground, but the Supreme Lord by the
expansion of Hi s plenary portion as Paramätmä is situated everywhere. He is
the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One
should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord one has hisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.duty to render service unto the Supreme . Everyone should be engaged in
devotional service to the Lord in  full Kåñëa consciousness. That is
recommended in this verse.
Everyone should think that he is enga ged in a particular type of occupation
by Håñékeça, the master of the senses. And by the result of the work in which
one is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, should be
worshiped. If one thinks alwa ys in this way, in full Kåñëa consciousness, then,
by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fu lly aware of everything. That is the
perfection of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä  (12.7), teñäm ahaà
samuddhartä.  The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of deliv ering such a
devotee. That is the highest perfection of life. In whatever occupation one may
be engaged, if he serves the Supr eme Lord he will achieve the highest
perfection.

TRANSLATIONCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.It is better to engage in one’s own o ccupation, even though one may perform
it imperfectly, than to accept another’s occupation and perform it perfectly.
Duties prescribed according to one’s nature are never affected by sinful
reactions.
PURPORT
One’s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-gétä.  As already discussed
in previous verses, the duties of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya  and çüdra  are
prescribed according to their particular modes of nature. One should not
imitate another’s duty. A man  who is by nature attracted to the kind of work
done by çüdras  should not artificially claim to be a brähmaëa,  although he may
have been born into a brähmaëa  family. In this way one should work according
to his own nature; no work is abominable, if perform ed in the service of the
Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of a brähmaëa  is certainly in the mode
of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should
not imitate the occupational duty of a brähmaëa.  For a kñatriya,  or
adminis trator, there are so many abominable things; a kñatriya  has to be
violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a kñatriya  has to tell lies for the sake
of diplomacy. Such violence and duplic ity accompany political affairs, but a
kñatriya  is not supposed to g ive up his occupational duty and try to perform the
duties of a brähmaëa.
One should act to satisfy the Suprem e Lord. For example, Arjuna was a
kñatriya.  He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is
performed for the sake of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there
need be no fear of degradation. I n the business field also, sometimes a
merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there
can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, “Oh, my dear customer, for you I
am making no profit,” but one should know that without prof it the merchant
cannot exist. Therefore it should be ta ken as a simple lie if a merchant says
that he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because
he is engaged in an occupation in whic h the telling of lies is compulsory, he
shoul d give up his profession and pursue the profession of a brähmaëa.  That isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.not recommended. Whether one is a kñatriya,  a vaiçya,  or a çüdra  doesn’t
matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even
brähmaëas,  who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill
animals because sometimes animals ar e sacrificed in such ceremonies.
Similarly, if a kñatriya  engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is
no sin incurred. In the Third Chap ter these matters have been clear ly and
elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of Yajïa, or for
Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhea d. Anything done for personal sense
gratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be
engaged accordin g to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he
should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.

Every endeavor is covered by some fault , just as fire is covered by smoke.
Therefore one should not give up the work born of his nature, O son of Kunté,
even if such work is full of fault.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT
In conditioned life, all work is co ntaminated by the material modes of
nature. Even if one is a brähmaëa,  he has to perform sacrifices in which animal
killing is necessary. Similarly, a kñatriya,  however pious he may be, has to fight
enemies. He cannot avo id it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be,
must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to
do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid
them. Similarly, even though a man is a çüdra serving a bad master, he has to
carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite
these flaws, one should continue to carry  out his prescribed duties, for they are
born out of his own nature.
A very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is
smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire  impure. Even though there is smoke
in the fire, fire is still considered to be  the purest of all elements. If one prefers
to give up the work  of a kñatriya  and take up the occupation of a brähmaëa,  he
is not assured that in the occupation of a brähmaëa  there are no unpleasant
duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be
completely free from the contamination of materia l nature. This example of
fire and smoke is very appropriate in th is connection. When in wintertime one
takes a stone from the fire, sometimes sm oke disturbs the eyes and other parts
of the body, but still one must make  use of the fire despite disturbing
conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because
there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve
the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in Kåñëa consciousness. That is the
perfectional point. When  a particular type of occupation is performed for the
satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation
are purified. When the results of wo rk are purified, when connected with
devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing  the self within, and that is
self-realization.

One who is self-controlled and unatta ched and who disregards all material

PURPORT
Real renunciation means that one shou ld always think himself part and
parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefor e think that he has no right to enjoy
the results of his work. Since he is pa rt and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the
results of his work must be enj oyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually
Kåñëa consciousness. The person acting  in Kåñëa consciousness is really a
sannyäsé,  one in the renounced order of life. By such a mentality, one is
satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached
to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in
anything beyond the transcendental ha ppiness derived from the service of the
Lord. A sannyäsé  is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.but a pers on who is in Kåñëa consciousness automatically attains this
perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This
state of mind is called yogärüòha,  or the perfectional stage of yoga.  As
confirmed in the Third Chapter, yas tv ätma-rat ir eva syät : one who is satisfied
in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his activity.

Being purified by his intelligence and controlling the mind with

peaceful—such a person is certainly elevated to the position of se lf-realization.
PURPORT
When one is purified by intelligence, he keeps himself in the mode of
goodness. Thus one becomes the controller of the mind and is always in trance.
He is not attached to the objects of sense gratification, and he is free from
attachment and hatred in his activities. Such a detached person naturally
prefers to live in a secluded place, he does not eat more than what he requires,
and he controls the activities of hi s body and mind. He has no false ego
because he does not accept the body as himself. Nor has h e a desire to make
the body fat and strong by accepting so  many material things. Because he has
no bodily concept of life, he is not fals ely proud. He is satisfied with everything
that is offered to him by the grace of  the Lord, and he is never angry in th e
absence of sense gratification. Nor does he endeavor to acquire sense objects.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Thus when he is completely free from fa lse ego, he becomes nonattached to all
material things, and that is the stage of self-realization of Brahman. That stage
is called the brahma-bhüta  stage. When one is free from the material
conception of life, he becomes peaceful and cannot be agitated. This is
described in Bhagavad-gétä  (2.70):

One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the SupremeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have
anything. He is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he
attains pure devotional service unto Me.
PURPORT
To the impersonalist, achieving the brahma-bhüta  stage, becoming one with
the Absolute, is the last word. But for th e personalist, or pure devotee, one has
to go still further, to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means
that one who is engage d in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is
already in a state of liberation, called brahma-bhüta,  oneness with the
Absolute. Without being one with th e Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot
render service unto Him. In th e absolute conception, there is  no difference
between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher
spiritual sense.
In the material concept of life, wh en one works for sense gratification,
there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure
devotional service, there is no misery . The devotee in Kåñëa consciousness has
nothing for which to lament or d esire. Since God is full, a living entity who is
engaged in God’s service, in Kåñëa cons ciousness, becomes also full in himself.
He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no
thought other than Kåñëa, he is naturally al ways joyful. He does not lament for
any material loss or aspire for gain, becaus e he is full in the service of the Lord.
He has no desire for material enjoymen t, because he knows that every living
entity is a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore
eternally a servant. He does not see, in  the material world, someone as higher
and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee
has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him
stone and gol d are of equal value. This is the brahma-bhüta  stage, and this stage
is attained very easily by the pure devo tee. In that stage of existence, the idea
of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one’s
individuality becomes hellish, the idea o f attaining the heavenly kingdom
becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses  are like serpents’ teeth that areCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.broken. As there is no fear of a serpen t with broken teeth, there is no fear
from the senses when they are automa tically controlled. The world is mise rable
for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good
as Vaikuëöha, or the spiritual sky. Th e highest personality in this material
universe is no more significant than an  ant for a devotee. Such a stage can be
achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pure devotional service
in this age.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead,  Kåñëa, and His plenary portionsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.cannot be understood by mental sp eculation nor by the nondevotees. If
anyone wants to understand the Suprem e Personality of Godhead, he has to
take to pure devotional service under the gui dance of a pure devotee.
Otherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will always be
hidden. As already stated in Bhagavad-gétä  (7.25), nähaà prakäçaù sarvasya:
He is not revealed to everyone. No one can understand God simply by erudite
schol arship or mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in Kåñëa
consciousness and devotional service can understand what Kåñëa is.
University degrees are not helpful.
One who is fully conversant with the Kåñëa science becomes eligible to
enter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Kåñëa. Becoming Brahman does
not mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as
devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of
devotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation.
Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual
life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure
Kåñëa consciousness. One should not mistakenly think that the word viçate,
“enters into Me,” supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous
with the impersonal Brahman. No. Viçate  means that one can enter into t he
abode of the Supreme Lord in one’s indi viduality to engage in His association
and render service unto Him. For instan ce, a green bird enters a green tree not
to become one with the tree but to enjo y the fruits of the tree. impersonalists
generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This
may be a source of happiness for the im personalist, but the personalist keeps
his personal individuality like an aquati c in the ocean. We find so many living
entities within the ocean, if we g o deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean
is not sufficient; one must have comple te knowledge of the aquatics living in
the ocean depths.
Because of his pure devotional serv ice, a devotee can understand the
transcendental qualities and the opulence s of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it
is stated in the Eleventh Chapter , only by devotional service can one
understand. The same is confirmed here ; one can understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.After attainment of the brahma-bhüta  stage of freedom from material
conceptions, devotional service begins by one’s hearing about the Lord. When
one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bhüta  stage
develops, and material contamination—gre ediness and lust for sense
enjoyment—disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a
devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such
attachment he becomes free from material  contamination. In that state of life
he ca n understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of
Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also. After liberation the process of bhakti,  or
transcendental service, continues. The Vedänta-sütra  (4.1.12 ) confirms this:
ä-präyaëät taträpi hi dåñöam.  This means that after libe ration the process of
devotional service continues. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  real devotional
liberation is defined as the reinstatem ent of the living entity in his own
identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already
expla ined: every living entity is a part-a nd-parcel fragmental portion of the
Supreme Lord. Therefore his constituti onal position is to serve. After
liberation, this service is never stopped.  Actual liberation is getting free from
misconceptions of life.

TRANSLATION
In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection.
In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.
PURPORT
When one acts in Kåñëa consciousness, he does not act as the master of the
world. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the
Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual  independence. He acts only on the
order of the master. A servan t acting on behalf of the supreme master is
unaffected by profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms
of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under
the personal direction of Kåñë a but when Kåñëa is not pre sent how should one
act? If one acts according to the dire ction of Kåñëa in this book, as well as
under the guidance of the representative of Kåñëa, then the result will be the
same. The Sanskrit word mat-paraù  is very important in this verse. It indicates
that one has no goal in life save and except acting in Kåñëa consciousness just
to satisfy Kåñëa. And while working in that way, one should think of Kåñëa
only: “I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Kåñëa.” While
acting in such a way , one naturally has to think of Kåñëa. This is perfect Kåñëa
consciousness. One should, however, note that after doing something
whimsically he should not offer the resu lt to the Supreme Lord. That sort of
duty is not in the devotional service of Kåñëa con sciousness. One should act
according to the order of Kåñëa. This is  a very important point. That order of
Kåñëa comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master.
Therefore the spiritual master’s orde r should be taken as the prime duty  of life.
If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then
one’s perfection of life in Kåñëa consciousness is guaranteed.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  58

If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of
conditioned life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such
consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.
PURPORT
A person in full Kåñëa consciousness is not unduly anxious about executing
the duties of his existence. The foolish cannot understand this great freedom
from all anxiety. For one who acts in Kåñëa consciousness, Lord Kåñëa becomes
the most intimate friend.  He always looks after His friend’s comfort, and He
gives Himself to His friend, who is so  devotedly engaged working twenty-four
hours a day to please the Lord. Therefor e, no one should be carried away by
the false ego of the bodily concept of life. One sh ould not falsely think himself
independent of the laws of material natu re or free to act. He is already underCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.strict material laws. But as soon as he acts in Kåñëa consciousness, he is
liberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very ca refully
that one who is not active in Kåñëa co nsciousness is losing himself in the
material whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul
actually knows what is to be done and wh at is not to be done, but a person who
acts in Kåñëa conscio usness is free to act because everything is prompted by
Kåñëa from within and confirmed by the spiritual master.

If you do not act according to My direction and do not fight, then you will

PURPORT
Arjuna was a military man, and born of the nature of the kñatriya.
Therefore his natural duty was to fight. But due to false ego he was fearing thatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.by killing his teacher, grandfather and fr iends he would incur sinful reactions.
Actually he was considerin g himself master of his actions, as if he were
directing the good and bad results of su ch work. He forgot that the Supreme
Personality of Godhead was present there, instructing him to fight. That is the
forgetfulness of the conditioned soul. The Supreme Pe rsonality gives
directions as to what is good and what is bad, and one simply has to act in
Kåñëa consciousness to attain the perfec tion of life. No one can ascertain his
destiny as the Supreme Lord can; therefor e the best course is to take direction
from the Supreme Lord and act. No one should neglect the order of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master, who is
the representative of God. One should act unhesitatingly to execute the order
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead —that will keep one safe under all
circumstances.

If one refuses to act under the direct ion of the Supreme Lord, then he is

Arjuna was not the supreme knower, an d his decision to fight or not to
fight was confined to his limited discre tion. Lord Kåñëa instructed that the
individual is not all in all. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He
Himself, Kåñëa, as the localized Sup ersoul, sits in the heart directing the living
being. After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the
Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness
of all his activities. Therefore all the activities  of living entities are directed by
this Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the
material body, which is created in the material energy under the direction of
the Supersoul. As soon as a living  entity is placed in a particu lar type of body,
he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a
high-speed motorcar goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the
living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the
Suprem e Soul, material nature fashions a part icular type of body to a particular
type of living entity so that he may work according to his past desires. The
living entity is not independent. One should not think himself independent of
the Supreme Personality of  Godhead. The individual is always under the
Lord’s control. Therefore one’s duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction
of the next verse.

A living entity should therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is situated in everyone’s heart, and that will relieve him from all
kinds of miseries of this material existence. By such surrender, not only will
one be released from all miseries in this life, bu t at the end he will reach the
Supreme God. The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature
(Åg Veda  1.22.20 ) as tad viñëoù paramaà padam.  Since all of creation is the
kingdom of God, everything material is actual ly spiritual, but paramaà padam
specifically refers to the eternal abode, which is called the spiritual sky or
Vaikuëöha.
In the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä  it is stated, sarvasya cähaà hådi
sanniviñöaù : the Lord is seated in everyone’s heart. So this recommendation
that one should surrender unto the Su persoul sitting within means that one
should surrender unto the Sup reme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Kåñëa has
already been accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme. He was accepted in the
Tenth Chapter as paraà brahma paraà dhäma . Arjuna has accepted Kåñëa as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the supreme abode of all liv ing
entities, not only because of his person al experience but also because of the
evidence of great authorities like Närada, Asita, Devala and Vyäsa.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.TEXT  63

PURPORT
The Lord has already explained to Arjuna the knowledge of brahma-bhüta.
One who is in the brahma-bhüta  condition is joyful; he never laments, nor does
he desire anything. That is due to conf idential knowledge. Kåñëa also discloses
knowledge of the Supersou l. This is also Brahman knowledge, knowledge of
Brahman, but it is superior.
Here the words yathecchasi tathä kuru —“As you like, you may
act”—indicate that God does not interfer e with the little independence of the
living entity. In Bhagavad-gétä,  the Lord has explained in all respects how one
can elevate his living condition. The best advice imparted to Arjuna is to
surrender unto the Supersoul seated with in his heart. By right discrimination,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.one should agree to act according to th e order of the Supersoul. That will help
one become situated constantly in Kåñëa consciousness, the h ighest
perfectional stage of human life. Arjuna is being directly ordered by the
Personality of Godhead to fight. Su rrender to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is in the best interest of the livi ng entities. It is not for the interest of
the Supreme. Bef ore surrendering, one is free to deliberate on this subject as
far as the intelligence goes; that is the be st way to accept the instruction of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such  instruction comes also through the
spiritual master, the bona fide repre sentative of Kåñëa.

The same instruction is repeated here to stress the essence of the teachings of
Bhagavad-gétä.  This essence is not understood by a common man, but by  one
who is actually very dear to Kåñëa, a pure devotee of Kåñëa. This is the most

PURPORT
The most confidential part of knowle dge is that one should become a pure
devotee of Kåñëa and always think of Him and act for Him. One should not
become an official meditator. Life shou ld be so molded that one will always
have the chance to think of Kåñëa.  One should always act in such a way that
all his daily activities are in connection with Kåñëa. He should arrange his life
in such a way that throughout the twenty-four hours he cannot but think of
Kåñëa. And the Lord’s promise is that anyone who is in su ch pure Kåñëa
consciousness will certainly return to the abode of Kåñëa, where he will be
engaged in the association of Kåñëa face to face. This most confidential part of
knowledge is spoken to Arjuna becaus e he is the dear friend of Kåñëa.
Everyone who fo llows the path of Arjuna can become a dear friend to Kåñëa
and obtain the same perfection as Arjuna.
These words stress that one should co ncentrate his mind upon Kåñëa—the
very form with two hands carrying a flut e, the bluish boy with a beautiful face
and peacock feathers in His hair. There are descriptions of Kåñëa found in the
Brahma-saàhitä  and other l iteratures. One should fix his mind on this original
form of Godhead, Kåñëa. One should no t even divert his attention to other
forms of the Lord. The Lord has multiforms as Viñëu, Näräyaëa, Räma,
Varäha, etc., but a devotee should concentrate his mind on t he form that was
present before Arjuna. Concentration of the mind on the form of Kåñëa
constitutes the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to
Arjuna because Arjuna is the most dear friend of Kåñëa’s.

Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver
you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.
PURPORT
The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge and processes of
religion—knowledge of the Supreme Br ahman, knowledge of the Supersoul,
knowledge of the different types of orders  and statuses of social life, knowledge
of the renounced order of life, know ledge of nonattachment, sense and mind
control, meditation, etc. He has descri bed in so many ways different types of
religion. Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-gétä,  the Lord says that Arjuna should
give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he  should simply
surrender to Kåñëa. That surrender wi ll save him from all kinds of sinful
reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.
In the Seventh Chapter  it was said that only one who has become free from
all sinful reactions can take to the wors hip of Lord Kåñëa. Thus one may think
that unless he is free from all sinf ul reactions he cannot take to the
surrendering process. To such do ubts it is here said that  even if one is not free
from all sinful reactions, simply by th e process of surrendering to Çré Kåñëa he
is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from
sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly  accept Kåñëa as the supreme saviorCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.
The process of surrender to Kåñëa is described in the Hari-bhakti-viläsa
(11.676 ):
änukülyasya saìkalpaù
prätikülyasya varjanam
rakñiñyatéti viçväso
goptåtve varanaà tathä
ätma-nikñepa-kärpaëye
ñaò-vidhä çaraëägatiù
According to the devotional proce ss, one should simply accept such
religious principles that will lead ultima tely to the devotional service of the
Lord. One may perform a particular o ccupational duty according to his
position in the social order, but if by  executing his duty one does not come to
the point of Kåñëa consciousness, all hi s activities are in vain. Anything that
does not lead to the perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness should be
avoided. One should be confiden t that in all circumstances Kåñ ëa will protect
him from all difficulties. There is no n eed of thinking how one should keep the
body and soul together. Kåñëa will see to  that. One should always think himself
helpless and should consider Kåñëa the only basis for his progress in life. As
soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full
Kåñëa consciousness, at once he be comes freed from all contamination of
material nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory
processes by cultivation of k nowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system,
etc., but one who surrenders unto Kåñë a does not have to execute so many
methods. That simple surrender unto Kåñëa will save him from unnecessarily
wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all
sinful reactions.
One should be attracted by the beautifu l vision of Kåñëa. His name is Kåñëa
because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful,
all-powerful, omnipotent vision of Kåñëa is fortunate. There are different
kinds of transcendentalists—som e of them are attached to the impersonal
Brahman vision, some of them are attrac ted by the Supersoul feature, etc., butCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as Kåñëa Himself, is the most  perfect transcendentalist. In other
words, devotional service to Kåñëa, in full consciousness, is the most
confidential part of knowledge, an d this is the essence of the whole
Bhagavad-gétä.  Karma-yogés,  empiric philosophers, mystics and devotees are all
called transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The
particular words used here, mä çucaù,  “Don’t fear, don’t hesitate, don’t worry,”
are very significant. One may be perplexed  as to how one can give up all kinds
of religious forms and simply surrender unto Kåñëa, but such worry is useless.

Persons who have not undergone the au sterities of the religious process,
who have never attempted devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness, who
have not tended a pure devotee, and especially those who are conscious of
Kåñëa only as a historical personalit y or who are envious of the greatness of
Kåñëa should not be told this most co nfidential part of knowledge. It is,
however, sometimes found that even demoniac persons who are envious of
Kåñëa, worshiping Kåñëa in a differe nt way, take to the profession of
explaining Bhagavad-gétä  in a different way to make business, but anyone who
desires actually to understand Kåñëa must avoid such commentaries on
Bhagavad-gétä.  Actually the purpose of Bhagavad-gétä  is not understandable to
those who are sensuous. Even if one is not sensuous but is strictly following the
disciplines enjoined in the Vedic script ure, if he is not a devotee he also
cannot understand Kåñëa. And even wh en one poses himself as a devotee of
Kåñëa but is not engaged in Kåñëa conscious activities, h e also cannot
understand Kåñëa. There are many persons who envy Kåñëa because He has
explained in Bhagavad-gétä  that He is the Supreme and that nothing is above
Him or equal to Him. There are many persons who are envious of Kåñëa. Such
persons should not b e told of Bhagavad-gétä,  for they cannot understand.
There is no possibility of faithless persons’ understanding Bhagavad-gétä  and
Kåñëa. Without understanding Kåñëa from the authority of a pure devotee,
one should not try to comment upon Bhagavad-gétä.

And one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from sinful
reactions and attains to the auspicious planets where the pious dwell.
PURPORT
In the sixty-seventh verse of this ch apter, the Lord explicitly forbade the
Gétä’s  being spoken to those who are envious of the Lord. In other words,
Bhagavad-gétä  is for the devotees only. But it so happens that sometimes a
devotee of the Lord will hold o pen class, and in that class not all the students
are expected to be devotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is
explained here that although not everyo ne is a devotee, still there are many
men who are not envious of Kåñë a. They have faith in Him as the SupremeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Personality of Godhead. If such person s hear from a bona fide devotee about
the Lord, the result is that they become  at once free from all sinful reactions
and after that attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are
situate d. Therefore simply by hearing Bhagavad-gétä,  even a person who does
not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities. Thus a
pure devotee of the Lord gives everyo ne a chance to become free from all
sinful reactions and to become a d evotee of the Lord.
Generally those who are free from sinful reactions, those who are righteous,
very easily take to Kåñëa consciousness. The word puëya-karmaëäm  is very
significant here. This refers to the pe rformance of great sacrifices, like the
açvamedha-yajïa,  mentioned in the Vedic literature. Those who are righteous
in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain the planetary
system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Mahäräja is presiding. He
is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a speci al planet, which is called the
polestar.

The Lord was acting as the spiritual ma ster of Arjuna. Therefore it was His
duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole Bhagavad-gétä
in its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or
the whole Bhagavad-gétä  if so required. Actually, anyone who hears
Bhagavad-gétä  from a bona fide spiritual master like Kåñëa or His
representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. Bhagavad-gétä  is not
an ordinary book written by a po et or fiction writer; it is spok en by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person fortunate enough to hear these
teachings from Kåñëa or from His bona fi de spiritual representative is sure to
become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance.

Arjuna said: My dear Kåñëa, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I

PURPORT
The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that
he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for
self-discipline. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu says that the actual position of the
living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this
principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in
serving the Supreme Lord he becomes th e liberated servant of God. The living
entity’s constitutional position is to be a servit or; he has to serve either the
illusory mäyä  or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his
normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then
certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this
material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as
the master of the world. This is called i llusion. When a person is liberated, his
illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act
accor ding to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of mäyä  to trap the
living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he
is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does
not think that if he  were God, then how could he  be in doubt? That he does
not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from
the illusory energy is to understa nd Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and agree to act according to His order .
The word moha  is very important in this verse. Moha  refers to that which is
opposed to knowledge. Actually real  knowledge is the understanding thatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.every living being is eternally a servit or of the Lord, but instead of thinking
oneself in that position, th e living entity thinks that  he is not a servant, that
he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material
nature. That is his illusion. This illusi on can be overcome by the mercy of the
Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee.  When that illusion is over, one agrees
to act in Kåñëa consciousness.
Kåñëa consciousness is acting according to Kåñëa’s order. A conditioned
soul, illusioned by the external ener gy of matter, does not know that the
Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor
of everything. Whatever He desir es He can bestow upon His devotees; He is
the friend of everyone, and He is especia lly inclined to His devotee. He is the
controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the
controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all
potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the
devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does
not become a devotee, but a servitor of mäyä.  Arjuna, however, after hearing
Bhagavad-gé tä from the Supreme Personality of  Godhead, became free from all
illusion. He could understand that Kå ñëa was not only his friend but the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood Kåñëa factually. So to
study Bhagavad-gétä  is to understand Kåñëa fa ctually. When a person is in full
knowledge, he naturally surrenders to Kåñëa. When Arjuna understood that it
was Kåñëa’s plan to reduce the unnecessa ry increase of population, he agreed
to fight according to Kåñëa’s desire. He again took up his weapons—hi s arrows
and bow—to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
In the beginning of Bhagavad-gétä , Dhåtaräñöra inquired from his secretary
Saïjaya, “What happened on the Battlefie ld of Kurukñetra?” The entire study
was related to the heart of Saïjaya by the grace of his spiritual master, Vyäsa.
He thus explained the th eme of the battlefield. The conversation was
wonderful because such an important conversation between two great souls
had never taken place before and would not take place again. It was wonderful
because the Supreme Personality of Godhead was speaking abou t Himself and
His energies to the living entity, Arju na, a great devotee of the Lord. If we
follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to un derstand Kåñëa, then our life will be
happy and successful. Saïjaya realized this, and as he began to understand it,
he relat ed the conversation to Dhåtaräñöra.  Now it is concluded that wherever
there is Kåñëa and Arjuna, there is victory.

TRANSLATION
By the mercy of Vyäsa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly
from the master of all mysticism, Kå ñëa, who was speaking personally to
Arjuna.
PURPORT
Vyäsa was the spiritual master of Saïjay a, and Saïjaya admits that it was by
Vyäsa’s mercy that he could understand  the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
This means that one has to understand Kåñëa not directly but through the
medium of the spiritual master.  The spiritual master is the transparent
medium, although it is true that the ex perience is still direct. This is the
mystery of the disciplic succession. When  the spiritual master is bona fide,
then one can hear Bhagavad-gétä  directly, as Arjuna heard it.  There are many
mystics and yogés  all over the world, but Kåñëa is the master of all yoga systems.
Kåñëa’s instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-gétä —surrender unto
Kåñëa. One who does so is the topmost yogé. This is confirmed in the last verse
of the Sixth Chapter. Yoginäm api sarveñäm.
Närada is the direct disciple of Kå ñëa and the spiritual master of Vyäsa.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Therefore Vyäsa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic
succession, and Saïjaya is the direct disc iple of Vyäsa. Therefore by the grace
of Vyäsa, Saïjaya’s senses  were purified, and he could see and hear Kåñëa
directly. One who directly hears Kåñëa can understand this confidential
knowledge. If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear
Kåñëa; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least  as far as
understanding Bhagavad-gétä  is concerned.
In Bhagavad-gétä,  all the yoga systems— karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga  and
bhakti-yoga —are explained. Kåñëa is the master of all such mysticism. It is to
be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand
Kåñëa directly, so, by the grace of V yäsa, Saïjaya was also able to hear Kåñëa
directly. Actually there is no differenc e between hearing directly from Kåñëa
and hearing directly from Kåñëa via a bo na fide spiritual master like Vyäsa.
The spiritual master is the representative of Vyäsadeva als o. Therefore,
according to the Vedic system, on the birthday of the spiritual master the
disciples conduct the ceremony called Vyäsa-püjä.

The understanding of Bhagavad-gétä  is so transcendental that anyone who
becomes conversant with the topics of Arjuna and Kåñëa becomes righteous
and he cannot forget such talks. This is the transcendental position of spiritual
life. In other words, one who  hears the Gétä from the right source, directly
from Kåñëa, attains full Kåñëa cons ciousness. The result of Kåñëa
consciousness is that one becomes increa singly enlightened, and he enjoys life
with a thrill, not only for some time, but at every moment.

It appears that Saïjaya also, by the grace of Vyäsa, could see the universal
form Kåñëa exhibited to Arjuna. It is, of course, said that Lord Kåñëa had
never exhibited such a form before. It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some
great devotees could also see the universal form of Kåñëa when it was shown to
Arjuna, and Vyäsa was one of them. He is one of the great devotees of the
Lord, and he is considered to be a powerful incarnation of Kåñëa. Vyäsa
disclosed this to his disciple Saïjaya, who remembered th at wonderful form of
Kåñëa exhibited to Arjuna and enjoyed it repeatedly.

TRANSLATIONCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Wherever there is Kåñëa, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is
Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory,
extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.
PURPORT
The Bhagavad-gétä  began with an inquiry of Dhåtaräñöra’s. He was hopeful
of the victory of his sons, assisted by  great warriors like Bhéñma, Droëa and
Karëa. He was hopeful that the vict ory would be on his side. But after
describing the scene on the battle field, Saïjaya told the King, “You are
thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Kåñëa and Arjuna are
present, there will be all good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhåtaräñöra
could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for th e side of Arjuna
because Kåñëa was there. Kåñëa’s accept ance of the post of charioteer for
Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. Kåñëa is full of all opulences,
and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such
renunciation, for Kåñ ëa is also the master of renunciation.
The fight was actually between Duryod hana and Yudhiñöhira. Arjuna was
fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiñöhira. Because Kåñëa and Arjuna
were on the side of Yudhiñöhira, Yudh iñöhira’s victory was certain. The battle
was to decide who would rule  the world, and Saïjaya predicted that the power
would be transferred to Yudhiñöhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhiñöhira,
after gaining victory in this battle, wo uld flourish more and more because not
only was he righteous and pious but he was also  a strict moralist. He never
spoke a lie during his life.
There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gétä  t o  b e  a
discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book
cannot be scripture. Some may protest that Kåñëa incited Arjuna to fight,
which is immoral, but the reality of  the situation is clearly stated:
Bhagavad-gétä  is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction
of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse :
man-manä bhava mad-bhaktaù.  One must become a devotee of Kåñëa, and the
essence of all religion is to surrender unto Kåñëa ( sarva-dharmän parityajyaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja ). The instructions of Bhagavad-gétä  constitute the
supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be
purifying and may lead to this pr ocess, but the last instruction of the Gétä is
the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto Kåñëa. This is the
verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.
From Bhagavad-gétä  we can understand that to realize oneself by
philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully
surrender unto Kåñëa is the highest pe rfection. This is the essence of the
teachings of Bhagavad-gétä.  The path of regu lative principles according to the
orders of social life and according to th e different courses of religion may be a
confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are
confidential, meditation and cult ivation of knowledge are still mo re
confidential. And surrender unto Kåñëa in devotional service in full Kåñëa
consciousness is the most confidential in struction. That is the essence of the
Eighteenth Chapter.
Another feature of Bhagavad-gétä  is that the actual truth is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. The Absolute Truth is realized in three
features—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä, and ultimately the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Perf ect knowledge of the Absolute
Truth means perfect knowledge of Kåñëa.  If one understands Kåñëa, then all
the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding.
Kåñëa is transcendental, for He is a lways situated in His eternal internal
potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into
two classes, eternally conditioned and et ernally liberated. Such living entities
are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of Kåñëa.
Material energy is manifested i nto twenty-four divisions. The creation is
effected by eternal time, and it is cr eated and dissolved by external energy.
This manifestation of the cosmic wo rld repeatedly becomes visible and
invisible.
In Bhagavad-gétä  five principal subject matters have been discussed: the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, material  nature, the living entities, eternal
time and all kinds of activities. All is  dependent on the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kåñëa. All conc eptions of the Absolute Truth—impersonalCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.Brahman, localized Paramätmä and any other transcendental
conception—exist within the category of understanding the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Although su perficially the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the livi ng entity, material nature and time appear to be different,
nothing is different from the Supreme.  But the Supreme is always different
from everything. Lord Caitanya’s philosop hy is that of “inconceivable oneness
and difference.” This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of
the Absolute Truth.
The living entity in his original positi on is pure spirit. He is just like an
atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord Kåñëa may be compared to
the sun, and the living entities to suns hine. Because the living entities are the
marginal energy of Kåñ ëa, they have a tendency to be in contact either with
the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living
entity is situated between the two energi es of the Lord, and because he belongs
to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By
proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of Kåñëa.
Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.
